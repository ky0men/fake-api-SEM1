The Astrophysical Observatory's initial, primary purpose was to \"record the amount and character of the Sun's heat\". Charles Greeley Abbot was named SAO's first director, and the observatory operated solar telescopes to take daily measurements of the Sun's intensity in different regions of the optical electromagnetic spectrum. In doing so, the observatory enabled Abbot to make critical refinements to the Solar constant, as well as to serendipitously discover Solar variability. It is likely that SAO's early history as a solar observatory was part of the inspiration behind the Smithsonian's \"sunburst\" logo, designed in 1965 by Crimilda Pontes. In 1955, the scientific headquarters of SAO moved from Washington, D.C. to Cambridge, Massachusetts to affiliate with the Harvard College Observatory (HCO).[1] Fred Lawrence Whipple, then the chairman of the Harvard Astronomy Department, was named the new director of SAO. The collaborative relationship between SAO and HCO therefore predates the official creation of the CfA by 18 years. SAO's move to Harvard's campus also resulted in a rapid expansion of its research program. Following the launch of Sputnik (the world's first human-made satellite) in 1957, SAO accepted a national challenge[3] to create a worldwide satellite-tracking network, collaborating with the United States Air Force on Project Space Track.With the creation of NASA the following year and throughout the space race, SAO led major efforts in the development of orbiting observatories and large ground-based telescopes, laboratory and theoretical astrophysics, as well as the application of computers to astrophysical problems.",

McConnell, John Marshall, Don Conner and O.W. VanderVelden — who built a 24.5-inch (620 mm) Cassegrain reflecting telescope for Clark College in Vancouver, Washington, which paid for the materials to make the telescope. At the time, this instrument was one of the largest amateur-built telescopes in the world. However, once built, the college sought a clearer, darker area to install the telescope due to light pollution from Vancouver and nearby Portland, Oregon, and the typically wet and cloudy weather on the windward side of the Cascade Mountain Range. While traveling through Goldendale, Washington, the telescope builders met a local diner owner and city council member who suggested they donate the telescope to the town. An agreement was made and the telescope was donated by the college to Goldendale on the condition that the community would build an observatory to house the telescope. A local, non-profit organization was created to plan and support the observatory which was ultimately constructed one mile (1.6 km) north of the town center using donations, loans, and a $135,000 grant from the Economic Development Administration. The Observatory design was based on the University of Washington's Manastash Ridge Observatory built west of Ellensburg in 1972. Unlike that facility, the intent of the founders and community college was for Goldendale Observatory to serve primarily as a center of public science education. The Observatory was built over a period of several months and dedicated on October 13, 1973.[2] The south observatory dome has a diameter of 20 feet (6.1 m), and the north dome a diameter of 10 feet (3.0 m). The observatory served as the Astronomical League's official headquarters during a solar eclipse which occurred on February 26, 1979, six years after the observatory opened. Approximately 15,000 people came to the town of Goldendale on that date to observe the total eclipse. The Observatory, its lands, and its debt were acquired by the state government in 1980, after being operated by the Goldendale Observatory Corporation since its dedication.[3] The park received its designation as a \"state park heritage site\" in 2014.",

The telescope also suffers from serious thermal expansion problems due to the large thermal mass of the mirror, and the dome as a whole, which is much larger than necessary.

      "contentBottom": "For many years the primary world-class observatory in the Soviet Union was the Pulkovo Observatory outside Saint Petersburg, originally built in 1839. Like many observatories of its era, it was primarily dedicated to timekeeping, weather, navigation and similar practical tasks, with a secondary role for scientific research. Around its 50th anniversary a new 76 cm telescope, then the world's largest, was installed for deep space observation. Further upgrades were limited due to a variety of factors, while a number of much larger instruments were built around the world over the next few decades. <br> In the 1950s the Soviet Academy of Sciences decided to build a new telescope that would allow first-rate deep space observation. Design work started at Pulkovo in 1959 under the leadership of future Lenin Prize winner Bagrat K. Ioannisiani. With the goal of building the largest telescope in the world, a title long held by the 200 inch (5 m) Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory, the team settled on a new design of 6 m (236 inches). This is about the maximum size a solid mirror can have without suffering from major distortion when tilted. <br> A telescope's theoretical angular resolution is defined by its aperture, which in the case of the BTA's 6 m leads to a resolution of about 0.021 arcseconds. Atmospheric effects overwhelm this, so it becomes important to locate high-resolution instruments at high altitudes in order to avoid as much of the atmosphere as possible. The Pulkovo site, at 75 m above sea level, was simply not suitable for a high-quality instrument. While BTA was being designed another instrument, the RATAN-600 radio telescope, was also designed. It was decided that the two instruments should be co-located, allowing the construction of a single site to house the crews. To select the site, sixteen expeditions were dispatched to various regions of the USSR, and the final selection was in the North Caucasus Mountains near Zelenchukskaya at a height of 2,070 m.[1] In 1966 the Special Astrophysical Observatory was formed to host the BTA-6 and RATAN-600.",

It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site Historic Centre of Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments. <br> The observatory was opened in 1839. Originally, it was a brainchild of the German/Russian astronomer Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve, who would become its first director (in 1861, his son Otto Wilhelm von Struve succeeded him). The architect was Alexander Bryullov. The observatory was equipped with state-of-the-art devices, one of them being the a 15-inch (380 mm) aperture refractor, one of the largest refractors in the world at that time (see Great Refractor). <br> In 1885, the observatory was equipped with 30-inch (760 mm) refractor, which was the biggest usable refractor in the world, until the 36-inch (910 mm) telescope at the Lick Observatory in California a few years later. Both were built by Alvan Clark & Sons in Massachusetts. The principal line of work of the observatory consisted of determination of coordinates of stars and astronomical constants, such as precession, nutation, aberration and refraction, and also discovering and measuring double stars. The observatory's activities have also been connected to the geographical study of the territory of Russia and development of navigation. The star catalogues, containing the most precise positions of 374, and then 558 stars, were made for the years 1845, 1865, 1885, 1905 and 1930.",

Astrophysical research really gained momentum with the appointment of Feodor Bredikhin as a director of the Observatory in 1890 and transfer of Aristarkh Belopolsky from the Moscow Observatory, an expert in stellar spectroscopy and solar research. In 1923, they installed a big Littrow spectrograph, and in 1940 – a horizontal solar telescope, manufactured at a Leningrad factory. After having received an astrograph in 1894, the observatory began its work on astrophotography. In 1927, the Observatory received a zone astrograph and with its help the Russian astronomers catalogued the stars of the near-polar areas of the sky. Regular observation of movements of celestial poles began with the construction of the zenith telescope in 1904. In 1920, the Observatory started transmitting the exact time by radio signals. The observatory participated in the basic geodesic work, namely in measuring degrees of the arc of the meridian from the Danube to the Arctic Ocean (until 1851), and in triangulation of Spitsbergen in 1899–1901. Military geodesists and hydrographers used to work at the Observatory as interns. The Pulkovo Meridian, which passes through the center of the main building of the Observatory and is located at 30°19,6‘ east of Greenwich, was the point of departure for all former geographical maps of Russia.",

Its altazimuth mount dictates the need for a field derotation mechanism to maintain the orientation of the field of view. <br> Initial results were disappointing due to cracking of the first borosilicate mirror, which was replaced in 1978. The large housing dome and massive 42 tonne mirror make it difficult to maintain the telescope at a suitable constant temperature during observing sessions. Atmospheric turbulence caused by windflow over the nearby Caucasus peaks can lead to poor seeing at the site, and observations with an angular resolution better than an arcsecond are rare. Despite these shortcomings, the BTA-6 remains a significant instrument, able to image objects as faint as the 26th magnitude.",

It became operational on 25 February 2020, when it began data collection. It is Asia's first gravitational wave observatory, the first in the world built underground, and the first whose detector uses cryogenic mirrors. The design calls for an operational sensitivity equal to, or greater than, LIGO. <br> The ICRR was established in 1976 for cosmic ray studies. The LCGT project was approved on 22 June 2010. In January 2012, it was given its new name, KAGRA, deriving the \"KA\" from its location at the Kamioka mine and \"GRA\" from gravity and gravitational radiation.[4] The project is led by Nobelist Takaaki Kajita who had a major role in getting the project funded and constructed.

The first, TAMA 300, was located in Mitaka, Tokyo and operated 1998-2008, demonstrating the feasibility of KAGRA. The second, CLIO, has been operating since 2006 underground near the KAGRA site, and is being used to develop cryogenic technologies for KAGRA. <br> KAGRA has two arms, 3 km (1.9 mi) long, which form a laser interferometric gravitational wave detector. It is built in the Kamioka Observatory near the neutrino physics experiments. The excavation phase of tunnels was started in May 2012 and was completed on 31 March 2014. <br> KAGRA will detect gravitational waves from binary neutron star mergers at up to 240 Mpc away with a signal to noise ratio of 10. The expected number of detectable events in a year is two or three. To achieve the required sensitivity, the existing state of the art techniques as used by LIGO and VIRGO (low-frequency vibration-isolation system, high-power laser system, Fabry-Pérot cavities, resonant side band extraction method, and so on) will be extended with the use of an underground location, cryogenic mirrors, and a suspension point interferometer. <br>KAGRA has suffered numerous delays. Early planning had hoped to begin construction in 2005 and observation in 2009[6] but is now likely to enter operation in April 2020.[7] Excess water in the tunnels caused significant delays in 2014 and 2015.",

      "contentBottom": "The testing process lasted for many days, typically 45 days. Each movement was tested in 5 positions and 2 temperatures, in 10 series of 4 or 5 days each. The tolerances for error were much finer than any other standard, including the ISO 3159 chronometer standard that other testing bodies such as COSC use. Movements that passed the stringent tests were issued a certification from the observatory called a Bulletin de Marche, signed by the Director of the Observatory. The General Bulletin Order stated the testing criteria, and the actual performance of the movement. A movement with a bulletin from an observatory became known as an Observatory Chronometer, and such were issued a chronometer reference number by the Observatory. <br> The role of the observatories in assessing the accuracy of mechanical timepieces was instrumental in driving the mechanical watchmaking industry toward higher and higher levels of accuracy. As a result, today high quality mechanical watch movements have an extremely high degree of accuracy. However, no mechanical movement could ultimately compare to the accuracy of the quartz movements being developed. Accordingly, such chronometer certification ceased in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the advent of the quartz watch movement.",

Although it did not really get established, it carried the banner of desire for a real observatory in the area for a century. Finally, in 1876 an agreement between the Government and the city was reached to establish a real observatory. The Government was trying to execute on a national agenda of increased education, and this nexused with city's desire for an Observatory; Bordeaux would contribute 100,000 francs for its founding. <br> It was founded in 1879 on a hill overlooking the Garonne river. <br> The Bordeaux observatory was established in the late 1870s, and one of its first instruments was a Meridian circle. The instrument was built by Eichens with and glass objective of 19 cm by Henry. Also, an equatorial mounted refractor (glass lens) with 38 cm lens. The objective lens was made by Merz, and the mounting was done by Gautier and Eichens. Also a 13-inch (32 cm) aperture astrograph in support of the Carte du Ceil project.",

The sundial was restored in 1998 and 1972. <br> In March 2010, the French Ministry of Culture classified the building and the large gate as protected historical monuments. <br> Flammarion's second wife, Gabrielle Renaudot Flammarion, bequeathed the entire site to the Société Astronomique de France upon her death in 1962. In 1971, the society signed a 99-year lease with the municipality of Juvisy to ensure the site's maintenance, preservation and accessibility. Today, the society organises regular observations at the observatory for the general public.",

This happens on about 45 days per year on average, mostly during winter. Good weather conditions often follow a Mistral. On average, atmospheric absorption at OHP is roughly twice that seen at the European Southern Observatory (ESO) at La Silla, Chile. <br> The main-belt asteroid 7755 Haute-Provence, discovered by Belgian astronomer Eric Elst in 1989, was named for the region where the discovering observatory is located.",

      "content": "Observations by the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope have taken advantage of gravitational lensing to reveal the largest sample of the faintest and earliest known galaxies in the universe. Some of these galaxies formed just 600 million years after the Big Bang and are fainter than any other galaxy yet uncovered by Hubble. The team has determined, for the first time with some confidence, that these small galaxies were vital to creating the universe that we see today.<br  /><br  />An international team of astronomers, led by Hakim Atek of the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland, has discovered over 250 tiny galaxies that existed only 600-900 million years after the Big Bang — one of the largest samples of dwarf galaxies yet to be discovered at these epochs. The light from these galaxies took over 12 billion years to reach the telescope, allowing the astronomers to look back in time when the universe was still young.<br  /><br  />Although impressive, the number of galaxies found at this early epoch is not the team’s only remarkable breakthrough, as Johan Richard from the Observatory of Lyon, France, points out, “The faintest galaxies detected in these Hubble observations are fainter than any other yet uncovered in the deepest Hubble observations.”<br  /><br  />By looking at the light coming from the galaxies, the team discovered that the accumulated light emitted by these galaxies could have played a major role in one of the most mysterious periods of the universe’s early history — the epoch of reionization. Reionization started when the thick fog of hydrogen gas that cloaked the early universe began to clear. Ultraviolet light was now able to travel over larger distances without being blocked and the universe became transparent to ultraviolet light.<br  /><br  />By observing the ultraviolet light from the galaxies found in this study, the astronomers were able to calculate whether these were in fact some of the galaxies involved in the process. The team determined, for the first time with some confidence, that the smallest and most abundant of the galaxies in the study could be the major actors in keeping the universe transparent. By doing so, they have established that the epoch of reionization, which ends at the point when the universe is fully transparent, came to a close about 700 million years after the Big Bang."

      "content": "April 26, 2005<br  />By crashing the nuclei of gold atoms into each other at 99.995 percent of the speed of light, physicists at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, have created a new state of matter — a nearly perfect liquid of strongly interacting quarks and gluons, the fundamental components of matter. The liquid's surprising properties are challenging theorists and may shed light on the universe's earliest moments.<br  /><br  />Scientists reported the findings last Monday at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Tampa, Florida.<br  /><br  />\"This is our first opportunity to view this phase of matter in the laboratory, rather than just knowing it must have existed in the Big Bang,\" Scott Pratt, a nuclear theorist at Michigan State University, told Astronomy.<br  /><br  />The emergence of liquid-like drops from the enormously energetic collisions between gold nuclei surprised most physicists. They expected amorphous quark-gluon plasma, a hot gas that quarks could zip through easily. Instead, they found a substance that flowed and responded to pressure like a liquid, and stripped energy from speeding particles extremely quickly.<br  /><br  />\"It was surprising for it to have such strongly, obviously, liquid-like properties,\" said Samuel Aronson, Brookhaven's associate director for high energy and nuclear physics.<br  /><br  />Two features proved the liquid nature of the \"mini bangs,\" created within Brookhaven's huge Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, which recreates the extreme conditions that existed a millionth of a second after the Big Bang.<br  /><br  />The initially football-shape droplets expanded faster in width than length, something amorphous plasma could not do. \"The explosions had a lot of asymmetry,\" Pratt noted, \"and this can only happen if the system is expanding according to the hydrodynamics of an almost perfect fluid.\"<br  /><br  />Also, experimenters detected far fewer jets of energetic particles than expected. They calculated that particles trying to escape the collision zone were losing energy at an enormous rate — more than a billion billion times faster than charged particles moving through ordinary matter.<br  /><br  />\"Even the most high-energy particles lose more energy than people thought,\" Pratt said. \"It's like even Shaquille O'Neal has trouble getting through the crowd.\"<br  /><br  />While this new liquid phase of matter is surprising, it doesn't threaten quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the standard theory that describes the universe's fundamental forces and particles. \"Nothing in these blobs violates QCD,\" said John Cramer, a heavy-ion researcher at the University of Washington. \"But starting from QCD, nobody knows how to predict in advance that they should behave like a liquid.\"<br  /><br  />According to Aronson, the ball is now in the theorists' court. They'll have to get better at applying QCD theory to show why matter under these extreme conditions — a billion times hotter than the Sun — behaves the way experimenters found. \"Now we can hold the theorists' feet to the fire,\" he said.<br  /><br  />Although the researchers believe they've recreated the conditions that existed in the first microsecond of the Big Bang, they still don't know enough about their quark-gluon liquid, or just how it \"freezes\" into protons and neutrons to make cosmological inferences.<br  /><br  />Pratt explained that if the primordial liquid stores enough latent heat to undergo a dramatic phase change, like water boiling, \"bubbles and drops could grow into seeds for later fluctuations in the universe, such as galaxies.\" Still, he cautioned, very preliminary results seem to show a more gradual transition.<br  /><br  />Cramer focused on the liquid itself. \"What it's telling us is that in the first microsecond after the Big Bang, the universe was a liquid that had a high compressibility. That would tend to damp out any fluctuations,\" he said. \"So it may change the way people try to evolve the universe from the Big Bang into galaxies and stars.\"<br  /><br  />It may, agreed Aronson. But, he added, \"It's too early to know yet.\""

      "summary": "The gas clouds are too diffuse to form stars and show virtually no signs of containing any metals.",
      "content": "Astronomers using the 10-meter telescopes at the W. M. Keck Observatory have detected two clumps of primordial gas in deep space from the dawn of time.<br  /><br  />The gas clouds are too diffuse to form stars and show virtually no signs of containing any “metals” — all elements heavier than hydrogen and helium, the two simplest and lightest elements in the universe. In fact, the only elements astronomers have detected in the clouds are hydrogen and its heavier isotope, deuterium.<br  /><br  />The lack of metals strongly suggests that the gases are reservoirs of the pristine material left over from the Big Bang. Because stars fuse atoms to make heavier elements, these gases have never been involved in any star making. In other words, they are the remnant gases that are unchanged since they were created in the first few minutes after the Big Bang.<br  /><br  />“Despite decades of effort to find anything metal-free in the universe, nature has previously set a limit to enrichment at no less than one-thousandth than that found in the Sun,” said J. Xavier Prochaska from the University of California (UC) Santa Cruz. “These clouds are at least 10 times lower than that limit and are the most pristine gas discovered in our universe.”<br  /><br  />“We’ve searched carefully for oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and silicon — the things that are found on Earth and the Sun in abundance,” Fumagalli said from UC Santa Cruz. “We don’t find a trace of anything other than hydrogen and deuterium.”<br  /><br  />Exactly how they can detect dark, cold, diffuse gas about 12 billion light-years away is a story in itself.<br  /><br  />“In this case we actually have to do a bit of a trick,” Prochaska said. “We study the gas in silhouette.” A more distant quasar provides the light for this. The quasar light shines though the gas, and the elements in the gas absorb specific wavelengths of light, which can only be found by splitting the light into detailed spectra to reveal the dark lines of missing light.<br  /><br  />In other words, said Fumagalli, “all of the analysis is on the light we didn’t get.” The clouds absorb only a small fraction of the quasar light that makes it to Earth. “But the signatures of hydrogen absorption are obvious, so there’s no doubt there’s a lot of gas there.”<br  /><br  />The blobs of pristine gas are good news to astronomers because they are confirmation of the theory of what the first elements were and how they were created in the Big Bang. Hydrogen, helium, lithium, and boron are the lightest elements on the periodic table of elements, and they were all created for the first time in what’s called the Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN).<br  /><br  />“That theory has been very well tested at Keck as regards to hydrogen and its isotope deuterium,” said O’Meara from St. Michael’s College in Colchester, Vermont. “One of the conundrums of that previous work, however, is that the gas also showed at least trace amounts of oxygen and carbon. The clouds that we have discovered are the first to match the full predictions of BBN.”<br  /><br  />The discovery also reveals how different the early universe was from today — where it’s very hard to find any place without some “metals” caused by generations of element-building fusion reactors, aka stars.<br  /><br  />“What excites me about this discovery is that there is almost a range of 1,000,000 in the metallicity in gases at that time in the universe,” said Fumagalli. In other words, there were places like our solar system — where metals are very abundant — and there were also places very unlike today, where metals were still virtually nonexistent, and the gases were unchanged since almost the beginning of time."

      "content": "A series of powerful observations has made it clear that our universe has expanded for billions of years, emerging from the hot, dense state we call the Big Bang. Over the past several decades, new types of precise measurements have allowed scientists to scrutinize and refine this account, letting them reconstruct the history of our universe in ever greater detail. When we compare the results from different kinds of measurements — the expansion rate of the universe, the temperature patterns in the light released when the first atoms formed, the abundances of various chemical elements, and the distribution of galaxies and other large-scale structures — we find stunning agreement. Each of these lines of evidence supports the conclusion that our universe expanded and evolved in just the way that the Big Bang theory predicts. From this perspective, our universe appears to be remarkably comprehensible.<br  /><br  />But cosmologists have struggled — if not outright failed — to understand essential facets of the universe. We know almost nothing about dark matter and dark energy, which together make up more than 95 percent of the total energy in existence today. We don’t understand how the universe’s protons, electrons, and neutrons could have survived the aftereffects of the Big Bang. In fact, everything we know about the laws of physics tells us that these particles should have been destroyed by antimatter long ago. And in order to make sense of the universe as we observe it, cosmologists have been forced to conclude that space, during its earliest moments, must have undergone a brief and spectacular period of hyperfast expansion — an event known as cosmic inflation. Yet we know next to nothing about this key era of cosmic history.<br  /><br  />It’s possible that these puzzles are little more than loose ends, each of which will be resolved as cosmologists continue to investigate our universe. But so far, these problems have proven to be remarkably stubborn and persistent. With the goal of identifying the individual particles that make up dark matter, scientists have designed and built a series of impressive experiments — yet no such particles have appeared. Even powerful particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider have revealed nothing that moves us closer to resolving any of these cosmic mysteries. And despite having measured the expansion history and large-scale structure of the universe in ever increasing detail, we have not gained any substantively greater understanding of the nature of dark energy, the force that seems to be accelerating the expansion of the cosmos.<br  /><br  />It is from this perspective that some cosmologists have found themselves asking whether these cosmic mysteries might be symptoms of something more significant than a few loose threads. Perhaps these puzzles are not as unrelated as they might seem, but are instead collectively pointing us toward a very different picture of our universe and its earliest moments.<br  /><br  />What we’ve learned by not discovering dark matter<br  /><br  />Dark matter is likely the most celebrated problem facing modern cosmologists."

Physicists from Imperial College London and the Universities of Copenhagen and Helsinki, however, believe there is a simpler explanation.<br  /><br  />In a new study, the team describes how the space-time curvature — in effect, gravity — provided the stability needed for the universe to survive expansion in that early period. The team investigated the interaction between the Higgs particles and gravity, taking into account how it would vary with energy.<br  /><br  />They show that even a small interaction would have been enough to stabilize the universe against decay.<br  /><br  />“The standard model of particle physics, which scientists use to explain elementary particles and their interactions, has so far not provided an answer to why the universe did not collapse following the Big Bang,” said Arttu Rajantie from Imperial College London. “Our research investigates the last unknown parameter in the standard model — the interaction between the Higgs particle and gravity. This parameter cannot be measured in particle accelerator experiments, but it has a big effect on the Higgs instability during inflation. Even a relatively small value is enough to explain the survival of the universe without any new physics!”<br  /><br  />The team plans to continue their research using cosmological observations to look at this interaction in more detail and explain what effect it would have had on the development of the early universe. In particular, they will use data from current and future European Space Agency missions measuring cosmic microwave background radiation and gravitational waves.<br  /><br  />“Our aim is to measure the interaction between gravity and the Higgs field using cosmological data,” said Rajantie. “If we are able to do that, we will have supplied the last unknown number in the standard model of particle physics and be closer to answering fundamental questions about how we are all here.”"

Some of these galaxies formed just 600 million years after the Big Bang and are fainter than any other galaxy yet uncovered by Hubble. The team has determined, for the first time with some confidence, that these small galaxies were vital to creating the universe that we see today.<br  /><br  />An international team of astronomers, led by Hakim Atek of the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland, has discovered over 250 tiny galaxies that existed only 600-900 million years after the Big Bang — one of the largest samples of dwarf galaxies yet to be discovered at these epochs. The light from these galaxies took over 12 billion years to reach the telescope, allowing the astronomers to look back in time when the universe was still young.<br  /><br  />Although impressive, the number of galaxies found at this early epoch is not the team’s only remarkable breakthrough, as Johan Richard from the Observatory of Lyon, France, points out, “The faintest galaxies detected in these Hubble observations are fainter than any other yet uncovered in the deepest Hubble observations.”<br  /><br  />By looking at the light coming from the galaxies, the team discovered that the accumulated light emitted by these galaxies could have played a major role in one of the most mysterious periods of the universe’s early history — the epoch of reionization. Reionization started when the thick fog of hydrogen gas that cloaked the early universe began to clear. Ultraviolet light was now able to travel over larger distances without being blocked and the universe became transparent to ultraviolet light.<br  /><br  />By observing the ultraviolet light from the galaxies found in this study, the astronomers were able to calculate whether these were in fact some of the galaxies involved in the process. The team determined, for the first time with some confidence, that the smallest and most abundant of the galaxies in the study could be the major actors in keeping the universe transparent. By doing so, they have established that the epoch of reionization, which ends at the point when the universe is fully transparent, came to a close about 700 million years after the Big Bang."

The liquid's surprising properties are challenging theorists and may shed light on the universe's earliest moments.<br  /><br  />Scientists reported the findings last Monday at a meeting of the American Physical Society in Tampa, Florida.<br  /><br  />\"This is our first opportunity to view this phase of matter in the laboratory, rather than just knowing it must have existed in the Big Bang,\" Scott Pratt, a nuclear theorist at Michigan State University, told Astronomy.<br  /><br  />The emergence of liquid-like drops from the enormously energetic collisions between gold nuclei surprised most physicists. They expected amorphous quark-gluon plasma, a hot gas that quarks could zip through easily. Instead, they found a substance that flowed and responded to pressure like a liquid, and stripped energy from speeding particles extremely quickly.<br  /><br  />\"It was surprising for it to have such strongly, obviously, liquid-like properties,\" said Samuel Aronson, Brookhaven's associate director for high energy and nuclear physics.<br  /><br  />Two features proved the liquid nature of the \"mini bangs,\" created within Brookhaven's huge Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, which recreates the extreme conditions that existed a millionth of a second after the Big Bang.<br  /><br  />The initially football-shape droplets expanded faster in width than length, something amorphous plasma could not do. \"The explosions had a lot of asymmetry,\" Pratt noted, \"and this can only happen if the system is expanding according to the hydrodynamics of an almost perfect fluid.\"<br  /><br  />Also, experimenters detected far fewer jets of energetic particles than expected. They calculated that particles trying to escape the collision zone were losing energy at an enormous rate — more than a billion billion times faster than charged particles moving through ordinary matter.<br  /><br  />\"Even the most high-energy particles lose more energy than people thought,\" Pratt said. \"It's like even Shaquille O'Neal has trouble getting through the crowd.\"<br  /><br  />While this new liquid phase of matter is surprising, it doesn't threaten quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the standard theory that describes the universe's fundamental forces and particles. \"Nothing in these blobs violates QCD,\" said John Cramer, a heavy-ion researcher at the University of Washington. \"But starting from QCD, nobody knows how to predict in advance that they should behave like a liquid.\"<br  /><br  />According to Aronson, the ball is now in the theorists' court. They'll have to get better at applying QCD theory to show why matter under these extreme conditions — a billion times hotter than the Sun — behaves the way experimenters found. \"Now we can hold the theorists' feet to the fire,\" he said.<br  /><br  />Although the researchers believe they've recreated the conditions that existed in the first microsecond of the Big Bang, they still don't know enough about their quark-gluon liquid, or just how it \"freezes\" into protons and neutrons to make cosmological inferences.<br  /><br  />Pratt explained that if the primordial liquid stores enough latent heat to undergo a dramatic phase change, like water boiling, \"bubbles and drops could grow into seeds for later fluctuations in the universe, such as galaxies.\" Still, he cautioned, very preliminary results seem to show a more gradual transition.<br  /><br  />Cramer focused on the liquid itself. \"What it's telling us is that in the first microsecond after the Big Bang, the universe was a liquid that had a high compressibility. That would tend to damp out any fluctuations,\" he said. \"So it may change the way people try to evolve the universe from the Big Bang into galaxies and stars.\"<br  /><br  />It may, agreed Aronson.

In fact, the only elements astronomers have detected in the clouds are hydrogen and its heavier isotope, deuterium.<br  /><br  />The lack of metals strongly suggests that the gases are reservoirs of the pristine material left over from the Big Bang. Because stars fuse atoms to make heavier elements, these gases have never been involved in any star making. In other words, they are the remnant gases that are unchanged since they were created in the first few minutes after the Big Bang.<br  /><br  />“Despite decades of effort to find anything metal-free in the universe, nature has previously set a limit to enrichment at no less than one-thousandth than that found in the Sun,” said J. Xavier Prochaska from the University of California (UC) Santa Cruz. “These clouds are at least 10 times lower than that limit and are the most pristine gas discovered in our universe.”<br  /><br  />“We’ve searched carefully for oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and silicon — the things that are found on Earth and the Sun in abundance,” Fumagalli said from UC Santa Cruz. “We don’t find a trace of anything other than hydrogen and deuterium.”<br  /><br  />Exactly how they can detect dark, cold, diffuse gas about 12 billion light-years away is a story in itself.<br  /><br  />“In this case we actually have to do a bit of a trick,” Prochaska said. “We study the gas in silhouette.” A more distant quasar provides the light for this. The quasar light shines though the gas, and the elements in the gas absorb specific wavelengths of light, which can only be found by splitting the light into detailed spectra to reveal the dark lines of missing light.<br  /><br  />In other words, said Fumagalli, “all of the analysis is on the light we didn’t get.” The clouds absorb only a small fraction of the quasar light that makes it to Earth. “But the signatures of hydrogen absorption are obvious, so there’s no doubt there’s a lot of gas there.”<br  /><br  />The blobs of pristine gas are good news to astronomers because they are confirmation of the theory of what the first elements were and how they were created in the Big Bang. Hydrogen, helium, lithium, and boron are the lightest elements on the periodic table of elements, and they were all created for the first time in what’s called the Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN).<br  /><br  />“That theory has been very well tested at Keck as regards to hydrogen and its isotope deuterium,” said O’Meara from St. Michael’s College in Colchester, Vermont. “One of the conundrums of that previous work, however, is that the gas also showed at least trace amounts of oxygen and carbon. The clouds that we have discovered are the first to match the full predictions of BBN.”<br  /><br  />The discovery also reveals how different the early universe was from today — where it’s very hard to find any place without some “metals” caused by generations of element-building fusion reactors, aka stars.<br  /><br  />“What excites me about this discovery is that there is almost a range of 1,000,000 in the metallicity in gases at that time in the universe,” said Fumagalli. In other words, there were places like our solar system — where metals are very abundant — and there were also places very unlike today, where metals were still virtually nonexistent, and the gases were unchanged since almost the beginning of time."

Over the past several decades, new types of precise measurements have allowed scientists to scrutinize and refine this account, letting them reconstruct the history of our universe in ever greater detail. When we compare the results from different kinds of measurements — the expansion rate of the universe, the temperature patterns in the light released when the first atoms formed, the abundances of various chemical elements, and the distribution of galaxies and other large-scale structures — we find stunning agreement. Each of these lines of evidence supports the conclusion that our universe expanded and evolved in just the way that the Big Bang theory predicts. From this perspective, our universe appears to be remarkably comprehensible.<br  /><br  />But cosmologists have struggled — if not outright failed — to understand essential facets of the universe. We know almost nothing about dark matter and dark energy, which together make up more than 95 percent of the total energy in existence today. We don’t understand how the universe’s protons, electrons, and neutrons could have survived the aftereffects of the Big Bang. In fact, everything we know about the laws of physics tells us that these particles should have been destroyed by antimatter long ago. And in order to make sense of the universe as we observe it, cosmologists have been forced to conclude that space, during its earliest moments, must have undergone a brief and spectacular period of hyperfast expansion — an event known as cosmic inflation. Yet we know next to nothing about this key era of cosmic history.<br  /><br  />It’s possible that these puzzles are little more than loose ends, each of which will be resolved as cosmologists continue to investigate our universe. But so far, these problems have proven to be remarkably stubborn and persistent. With the goal of identifying the individual particles that make up dark matter, scientists have designed and built a series of impressive experiments — yet no such particles have appeared. Even powerful particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider have revealed nothing that moves us closer to resolving any of these cosmic mysteries. And despite having measured the expansion history and large-scale structure of the universe in ever increasing detail, we have not gained any substantively greater understanding of the nature of dark energy, the force that seems to be accelerating the expansion of the cosmos.<br  /><br  />It is from this perspective that some cosmologists have found themselves asking whether these cosmic mysteries might be symptoms of something more significant than a few loose threads. Perhaps these puzzles are not as unrelated as they might seem, but are instead collectively pointing us toward a very different picture of our universe and its earliest moments.<br  /><br  />What we’ve learned by not discovering dark matter<br  /><br  />Dark matter is likely the most celebrated problem facing modern cosmologists."

Physicists from Imperial College London and the Universities of Copenhagen and Helsinki, however, believe there is a simpler explanation.<br  /><br  />In a new study, the team describes how the space-time curvature — in effect, gravity — provided the stability needed for the universe to survive expansion in that early period. The team investigated the interaction between the Higgs particles and gravity, taking into account how it would vary with energy.<br  /><br  />They show that even a small interaction would have been enough to stabilize the universe against decay.<br  /><br  />“The standard model of particle physics, which scientists use to explain elementary particles and their interactions, has so far not provided an answer to why the universe did not collapse following the Big Bang,” said Arttu Rajantie from Imperial College London. “Our research investigates the last unknown parameter in the standard model — the interaction between the Higgs particle and gravity. This parameter cannot be measured in particle accelerator experiments, but it has a big effect on the Higgs instability during inflation. Even a relatively small value is enough to explain the survival of the universe without any new physics!”<br  /><br  />The team plans to continue their research using cosmological observations to look at this interaction in more detail and explain what effect it would have had on the development of the early universe. In particular, they will use data from current and future European Space Agency missions measuring cosmic microwave background radiation and gravitational waves.<br  /><br  />“Our aim is to measure the interaction between gravity and the Higgs field using cosmological data,” said Rajantie. “If we are able to do that, we will have supplied the last unknown number in the standard model of particle physics and be closer to answering fundamental questions about how we are all here.”"

And despite having measured the expansion history and large-scale structure of the universe in ever increasing detail, we have not gained any substantively greater understanding of the nature of dark energy, the force that seems to be accelerating the expansion of the cosmos.<br  /><br  />It is from this perspective that some cosmologists have found themselves asking whether these cosmic mysteries might be symptoms of something more significant than a few loose threads. Perhaps these puzzles are not as unrelated as they might seem, but are instead collectively pointing us toward a very different picture of our universe and its earliest moments.<br  /><br  />What we’ve learned by not discovering dark matter<br  /><br  />Dark matter is likely the most celebrated problem facing modern cosmologists."

      "content": "New research by a team of European physicists could explain why the universe did not collapse immediately after the Big Bang.<br  /><br  />Studies of the Higgs particle — discovered at CERN in 2012 and responsible for giving mass to all particles — have suggested that the production of Higgs particles during the accelerating expansion of the early universe (inflation) should have led to instability and collapse.<br  /><br  />Scientists have been trying to find out why this didn’t happen, leading to theories that there must be some new physics that will help explain the origins of the universe that has not yet been discovered. Physicists from Imperial College London and the Universities of Copenhagen and Helsinki, however, believe there is a simpler explanation.<br  /><br  />In a new study, the team describes how the space-time curvature — in effect, gravity — provided the stability needed for the universe to survive expansion in that early period. The team investigated the interaction between the Higgs particles and gravity, taking into account how it would vary with energy.<br  /><br  />They show that even a small interaction would have been enough to stabilize the universe against decay.<br  /><br  />“The standard model of particle physics, which scientists use to explain elementary particles and their interactions, has so far not provided an answer to why the universe did not collapse following the Big Bang,” said Arttu Rajantie from Imperial College London. “Our research investigates the last unknown parameter in the standard model — the interaction between the Higgs particle and gravity. This parameter cannot be measured in particle accelerator experiments, but it has a big effect on the Higgs instability during inflation. Even a relatively small value is enough to explain the survival of the universe without any new physics!”<br  /><br  />The team plans to continue their research using cosmological observations to look at this interaction in more detail and explain what effect it would have had on the development of the early universe. In particular, they will use data from current and future European Space Agency missions measuring cosmic microwave background radiation and gravitational waves.<br  /><br  />“Our aim is to measure the interaction between gravity and the Higgs field using cosmological data,” said Rajantie. “If we are able to do that, we will have supplied the last unknown number in the standard model of particle physics and be closer to answering fundamental questions about how we are all here.”"

However, according to new theoretical research from two NASA astrophysicists, the wrenching gravity just outside the outer boundary of a black hole can produce yet another bizarre effect: light echoes.<br  /><br  />\"The light echoes come about because of the severe warping of spacetime predicted by Einstein,\" says Keigo Fukumura of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \"If the black hole is spinning fast, it can literally drag the surrounding space, and this can produce some wild special effects.\"<br  /><br  />Many black holes are surrounded by disks of searing hot gas that whirl around at nearly the speed of light. Hot spots within these disks sometimes emit random bursts of X-rays, which have been detected by orbiting X-ray observatories. But according to Fukumura and his colleague, Demosthenes Kazanas, things get more interesting when they take into account Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes how extremely massive objects like black holes can actually warp and drag the surrounding space-time.<br  /><br  />Many of these X-ray photons travel to Earth by taking different paths around the black hole. Because the black hole's extreme gravity warps the surrounding space-time, it bends the trajectories of the photons so they arrive here with a delay that depends on the relative positions of the X-ray flare, the black hole, and Earth."

The black hole has about 3.8 times the mass of our Sun, and is orbited by a companion star, as depicted in this illustration.<br  />NASA/CXC/A. Hobar<br  />April 1, 2008<br  />Using a new technique, two NASA scientists have identified the lightest known black hole. With a mass only about 3.8 times greater than our Sun and a diameter of only about 15 miles, the black hole lies very close to the minimum size predicted for black holes that originate from dying stars.<br  /><br  />\"This black hole is really pushing the limits. For many years astronomers have wanted to know the smallest possible size of a black hole, and this little guy is a big step toward answering that question,\" says lead author Nikolai Shaposhnikov of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.<br  /><br  />The tiny black hole resides in a Milky Way Galaxy binary system known as XTE J1650-500, named for its sky coordinates in the southern constellation Ara. NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) satellite discovered the system in 2001. Astronomers realized soon after J1650's discovery that it harbors a normal star and a relatively lightweight black hole. But the black hole's mass had never been measured to high precision.<br  /><br  />Shaposhnikov and his Goddard colleague Lev Titarchuk presented their results on Monday, March 31, at the American Astronomical Society High-Energy Astrophysics Division meeting in Los Angeles.<br  />In this top-down illustration of a black hole and its surrounding disk, gas spiraling toward the black hole piles up just outside it, creating a traffic jam. The traffic jam is closer in for smaller black holes, so X-rays are emitted on a shorter timescale.<br  />NASA<br  />The method used by Shaposhnikov and Titarchuk has been described in several papers in the Astrophysical Journal. It uses a relationship between black holes and the inner part of their surrounding disks, where gas spirals inward before making the fatal plunge. When the feeding frenzy reaches a moderate rate, hot gas piles up near the black hole and radiates a torrent of X-rays. The X-ray intensity varies in a pattern that repeats itself over a nearly regular interval. This signal is called a quasi-periodic oscillation, or QPO.<br  /><br  />Astronomers have long suspected that a QPO's frequency depends on the black hole's mass. In 1998, Titarchuk realized that the congestion zone lies close in for small black holes, so the QPO clock ticks quickly. As black holes increase in mass, the congestion zone is pushed farther out, so the QPO clock ticks slower and slower. To measure the black hole masses, Shaposhnikov and Titarchuk use archival data from RXTE, which has made exquisitely precise measurements of QPO frequencies in at least 15 black holes.<br  /><br  />Last year, Shaposhnikov and Titarchuk applied their QPO method to three black holes whose masses had been measured by other techniques. In their new paper, they extend their result to seven other black holes, three of which have well-determined masses. \"In every case, our measurement agrees with the other methods,\" says Titarchuk. \"We know our technique works because it has passed every test with flying colors.\"<br  />The measurement of the black hole's mass is due to high-precision timing observations made by NASA’s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite, shown here prior to launch.<br  />NASA<br  />When Shaposhnikov and Titarchuk applied their method to XTE J1650-500, they calculated a mass of 3.8 Suns, with a margin of uncertainty of only half a Sun. This value is well below the previous black hole record holder with a reliable mass measurement, GRO 1655-40, which tips the scales at about 6.3 Suns.<br  /><br  />Below some unknown critical threshold, a dying star should produce a neutron star instead of a black hole. Astronomers think the boundary between black holes and neutron stars lies somewhere between 1.7 and 2.7 solar masses. Knowing this dividing line is important for fundamental physics, because it will tell scientists about the behavior of matter when it is scrunched into conditions of extraordinarily high density.<br  /><br  />Despite the diminutive size of this new record holder, future space travelers had better beware. Smaller black holes like the one in J1650 exert stronger tidal forces than the much larger black holes found in the centers of galaxies, which make the little guys more dangerous to approach. \"If you ventured too close to J1650's black hole, its gravity would tidally stretch your body into a strand of spaghetti,\" says Shaposhnikov.<br  /><br  />Shaposhnikov adds that RXTE is the only instrument that can make the high-precision timing observations necessary for this line of research. \"RXTE is absolutely crucial for these black hole mass measurements,\" he says."

The black holes in the image are hundreds of millions to several billion times more massive than the sun and lie in the centers of galaxies.<br  /><br  />Material falling into these black holes at high rates generates huge amounts of light that can be detected in different wavelengths. These systems are known as active galactic nuclei, or AGN.<br  /><br  />\"We're trying to get a complete census across the universe of black holes and their habits,\" said Ryan Hickox of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"We used special tactics to hunt down the very biggest black holes.\"<br  /><br  />Instead of staring at one relatively small part of the sky for a long time, as with the Chandra Deep Fields — two of the longest exposures obtained with the observatory — this team scanned a much bigger portion with shorter exposures. Since the biggest black holes power the brightest AGN, they can be spotted at vast distances, even with short exposures.<br  /><br  />\"With this approach, we found well over a thousand of these monsters, and have started using them to test our understanding of these powerful objects,\" said co-investigator Christine Jones, also of the CfA.<br  /><br  />The new survey raises doubts about a popular current model in which a supermassive black hole is surrounded by a doughnut-shaped region, or torus, of gas. An observer from Earth would have their view blocked by this torus by different amounts, depending on the orientation of the torus.<br  /><br  />According to this model, astronomers would expect a large sample of black holes to show a range of absorption of the radiation from the nuclei. This absorption should range from completely exposed to completely obscured, with most in-between. Nuclei that are completely obscured are not detectable, but heavily obscured ones are.<br  /><br  />\"Instead of finding a whole range, we found nearly all of the black holes are either naked or covered by a dense veil of gas,\" said Hickox. \"Very few are in between, which makes us question how well we know the environment around these black holes.\"<br  /><br  />This study found more than 600 obscured and 700 unobscured AGN, located between about six and 11 billion light years from Earth. They were found using an early application of a new search method. By looking at the infrared colors of objects with Spitzer, AGN can be separated from stars and galaxies. The Chandra and optical observations then verify these objects are AGN. This multi-wavelength method is especially efficient at finding obscured AGN.<br  /><br  />\"These results are very exciting, using two NASA Great Observatories to find and understand the largest sample of supermassive black holes ever found in the distant universe\", said co-investigator Daniel Stern, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California."

The new black hole, with a mass 24 to 33 times that of our Sun, is the heftiest known black hole that orbits another star.<br  /><br  />The record-breaker belongs to the category of \"stellar-mass\" black holes. Formed in the death throes of massive stars, they are smaller than the monster black holes found in galactic cores. The previous record holder for largest stellar-mass black hole is a 16-solar-mass black hole in the galaxy M33, announced on October 17.<br  /><br  />\"We weren't expecting to find a stellar-mass black hole this massive,\" says Andrea Prestwich of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., lead author of the paper. \"We now know that black holes that form from dying stars can be much larger than we had realized.\"<br  />The black hole is located in the nearby dwarf galaxy IC 10, 1.8 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Cassiopeia. Prestwich's team could measure the black hole's mass because it has an orbiting companion: a hot, highly evolved star. The star is ejecting gas in the form of a wind. Some of this material spirals toward the black hole, heats up, and gives off powerful X-rays before crossing the point of no return.<br  /><br  />In November 2006, Prestwich and her colleagues observed the dwarf galaxy with NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. The group discovered that the galaxy's brightest X-ray source, IC 10 X-1, exhibits sharp changes in X-ray brightness. Such behavior suggests a star periodically passing in front of a companion black hole and blocking the X-rays, creating an eclipse.<br  /><br  />In late November, NASA's Swift satellite confirmed the eclipses and revealed details about the star's orbit. The star in IC 10 X-1 appears to orbit in a plane that lies nearly on the edge to Earth's line of sight. A simple application of Kepler's Laws show that the companion black hole has a mass of at least 24 Suns.<br  /><br  />There are still some uncertainties in the black hole's mass estimate, but as Prestwich notes, \"Future optical observations will provide a final check. Any refinements in the IC 10 X-1 measurement are likely to increase the black hole's mass rather than reduce it.\"<br  /><br  />The black hole's large mass is surprising because massive stars generate powerful winds that blow off many Suns worth of gas before the stars explode. Calculations suggest massive stars in our galaxy leave behind black holes no heavier than about 15 Suns.<br  /><br  />The IC 10 X-1 black hole has gained mass since its birth by gobbling up gas from its companion star, but the rate is so slow that the black hole would have gained no more than 1 or 2 solar masses. \"This black hole was born fat; it didn't grow fat,\" says astrophysicist Richard Mushotzky of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who is not a member of the discovery team.<br  /><br  />The progenitor star probably started its life with 60 or more solar masses. Like its host galaxy, it was probably deficient in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. In massive, luminous stars with a high fraction of heavy elements, the extra electrons of elements such as carbon and oxygen \"feel\" the outward pressure of light and are more susceptible to being swept away in stellar winds. But with its low fraction of heavy elements, the IC 10 X-1 progenitor shed comparatively little mass before it exploded, so it could leave behind a heavier black hole.<br  /><br  />\"Massive stars in our galaxy today are probably not producing very heavy stellar-mass black holes like this one,\" says co-author Roy Kilgard of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn. \"But there could be millions of heavy stellar-mass black holes lurking out there that were produced early in the Milky Way's history, before it had a chance to build up heavy elements.\""

      "content": "May 26, 2005<br  />What happens when a neutron star edges too close to a black hole? Recent studies applying relativistic instead of Newtonian rules show that, under most circumstances, neutron stars plunge directly into black holes without forming an accretion disk. These new findings will help astronomers trying to understand gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and listening for gravitational-wave signals from such events.<br  /><br  />Theorists first tried to analyze the encounter between a neutron star and a black hole using Newtonian physics — far easier to apply than relativity. Their studies suggested the black hole would strip mass from the neutron star while it remained in a stable orbit. This would form an accretion disk, and the transfer of mass would push the star into a higher orbit. Some studies showed neutron stars \"bouncing\" into eccentric orbits that would generate repeated bursts of gamma rays and gravitational waves. In most cases, GRBs and gravitational waves would appear over an extended period of time.<br  /><br  />M. Coleman Miller, an astrophysicist at the University of Maryland, has now tracked neutron star-black hole tangos under relativistic rules, with strikingly different results. He built on recent work by theorists Alessandra Buonanno (University of Paris), Stuart Shapiro (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), and Fred Rasio at Northwestern University, among others. The study will appear in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.<br  /><br  />Miller tells Astronomy that in Einstein's rubbery space-time, rather than forming accretion disks and orbiting black holes for extended periods, neutron stars plunge \"promptly\" into black holes.<br  /><br  />How promptly? According to Miller, once a neutron star ventures closer than 3 times the radius of a non-spinning black hole, it will vanish within a millisecond.<br  /><br  />\"When black holes eat neutron stars, they do it like snakes,\" Miller says. \"They swallow the neutron stars whole.\"<br  /><br  />In the relativistic space-time around a black hole, Miller finds, neutron stars rapidly lose angular momentum, which ripples away as gravitational waves. \"Even a small loss of angular momentum will lead to a rapid plunge,\" he says, so black holes gulp down neutron stars under almost all circumstances, even when the black hole is spinning rapidly in the same direction as the neutron star's orbit.<br  /><br  />Miller doesn't know what happens around a black hole spinning as fast as it can. That would require extremely difficult \"full general relativistic numerical calculations with no approximations.\" Still, he concludes, \"It appears possible that no plausible combination of neutron star and black hole masses, spins, and orbital inclinations will result in an accretion disk or stable mass transfer.\"<br  /><br  />Rasio finds the relativistic results far more realistic. \"For the first time ever, this paper gives, in my opinion, a correct description of the final fate of these mergers. This would imply no gamma-ray burst from such a merger, in contrast to many previous speculations.\"<br  /><br  />The gravitational-wave signal would also be different, Rasio tells Astronomy. \"The inspiral [chirp] signal would simply end without any dramatic signature corresponding to the final merger.\""

      "content": "The lowest-mass known black hole belongs to a binary system named XTE J1650-500. The black hole has about 3.8 times the mass of our Sun, and is orbited by a companion star, as depicted in this illustration.<br  />NASA/CXC/A. Hobar<br  />April 1, 2008<br  />Using a new technique, two NASA scientists have identified the lightest known black hole. With a mass only about 3.8 times greater than our Sun and a diameter of only about 15 miles, the black hole lies very close to the minimum size predicted for black holes that originate from dying stars.<br  /><br  />\"This black hole is really pushing the limits. For many years astronomers have wanted to know the smallest possible size of a black hole, and this little guy is a big step toward answering that question,\" says lead author Nikolai Shaposhnikov of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.<br  /><br  />The tiny black hole resides in a Milky Way Galaxy binary system known as XTE J1650-500, named for its sky coordinates in the southern constellation Ara. NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) satellite discovered the system in 2001. Astronomers realized soon after J1650's discovery that it harbors a normal star and a relatively lightweight black hole. But the black hole's mass had never been measured to high precision.<br  /><br  />Shaposhnikov and his Goddard colleague Lev Titarchuk presented their results on Monday, March 31, at the American Astronomical Society High-Energy Astrophysics Division meeting in Los Angeles.<br  />In this top-down illustration of a black hole and its surrounding disk, gas spiraling toward the black hole piles up just outside it, creating a traffic jam. The traffic jam is closer in for smaller black holes, so X-rays are emitted on a shorter timescale.<br  />NASA<br  />The method used by Shaposhnikov and Titarchuk has been described in several papers in the Astrophysical Journal. It uses a relationship between black holes and the inner part of their surrounding disks, where gas spirals inward before making the fatal plunge. When the feeding frenzy reaches a moderate rate, hot gas piles up near the black hole and radiates a torrent of X-rays. The X-ray intensity varies in a pattern that repeats itself over a nearly regular interval. This signal is called a quasi-periodic oscillation, or QPO.<br  /><br  />Astronomers have long suspected that a QPO's frequency depends on the black hole's mass. In 1998, Titarchuk realized that the congestion zone lies close in for small black holes, so the QPO clock ticks quickly. As black holes increase in mass, the congestion zone is pushed farther out, so the QPO clock ticks slower and slower. To measure the black hole masses, Shaposhnikov and Titarchuk use archival data from RXTE, which has made exquisitely precise measurements of QPO frequencies in at least 15 black holes.<br  /><br  />Last year, Shaposhnikov and Titarchuk applied their QPO method to three black holes whose masses had been measured by other techniques. In their new paper, they extend their result to seven other black holes, three of which have well-determined masses. \"In every case, our measurement agrees with the other methods,\" says Titarchuk. \"We know our technique works because it has passed every test with flying colors.\"<br  />The measurement of the black hole's mass is due to high-precision timing observations made by NASA’s Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer satellite, shown here prior to launch.<br  />NASA<br  />When Shaposhnikov and Titarchuk applied their method to XTE J1650-500, they calculated a mass of 3.8 Suns, with a margin of uncertainty of only half a Sun. This value is well below the previous black hole record holder with a reliable mass measurement, GRO 1655-40, which tips the scales at about 6.3 Suns.<br  /><br  />Below some unknown critical threshold, a dying star should produce a neutron star instead of a black hole. Astronomers think the boundary between black holes and neutron stars lies somewhere between 1.7 and 2.7 solar masses. Knowing this dividing line is important for fundamental physics, because it will tell scientists about the behavior of matter when it is scrunched into conditions of extraordinarily high density.<br  /><br  />Despite the diminutive size of this new record holder, future space travelers had better beware. Smaller black holes like the one in J1650 exert stronger tidal forces than the much larger black holes found in the centers of galaxies, which make the little guys more dangerous to approach. \"If you ventured too close to J1650's black hole, its gravity would tidally stretch your body into a strand of spaghetti,\" says Shaposhnikov.<br  /><br  />Shaposhnikov adds that RXTE is the only instrument that can make the high-precision timing observations necessary for this line of research. \"RXTE is absolutely crucial for these black hole mass measurements,\" he says."

Some of this material spirals toward the black hole, heats up, and gives off powerful X-rays before crossing the point of no return.<br  /><br  />In November 2006, Prestwich and her colleagues observed the dwarf galaxy with NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. The group discovered that the galaxy's brightest X-ray source, IC 10 X-1, exhibits sharp changes in X-ray brightness.

Like its host galaxy, it was probably deficient in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. In massive, luminous stars with a high fraction of heavy elements, the extra electrons of elements such as carbon and oxygen \"feel\" the outward pressure of light and are more susceptible to being swept away in stellar winds.

      "summary": "Extensive data analysis has led astronomers to believe they witnessed a giant black hole tear apart a star back in 2009.",
      "content": "May 26, 2005<br  />What happens when a neutron star edges too close to a black hole? Recent studies applying relativistic instead of Newtonian rules show that, under most circumstances, neutron stars plunge directly into black holes without forming an accretion disk. These new findings will help astronomers trying to understand gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and listening for gravitational-wave signals from such events.<br  /><br  />Theorists first tried to analyze the encounter between a neutron star and a black hole using Newtonian physics — far easier to apply than relativity. Their studies suggested the black hole would strip mass from the neutron star while it remained in a stable orbit. This would form an accretion disk, and the transfer of mass would push the star into a higher orbit. Some studies showed neutron stars \"bouncing\" into eccentric orbits that would generate repeated bursts of gamma rays and gravitational waves. In most cases, GRBs and gravitational waves would appear over an extended period of time.<br  /><br  />M. Coleman Miller, an astrophysicist at the University of Maryland, has now tracked neutron star-black hole tangos under relativistic rules, with strikingly different results. He built on recent work by theorists Alessandra Buonanno (University of Paris), Stuart Shapiro (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), and Fred Rasio at Northwestern University, among others. The study will appear in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.<br  /><br  />Miller tells Astronomy that in Einstein's rubbery space-time, rather than forming accretion disks and orbiting black holes for extended periods, neutron stars plunge \"promptly\" into black holes.<br  /><br  />How promptly? According to Miller, once a neutron star ventures closer than 3 times the radius of a non-spinning black hole, it will vanish within a millisecond.<br  /><br  />\"When black holes eat neutron stars, they do it like snakes,\" Miller says. \"They swallow the neutron stars whole.\"<br  /><br  />In the relativistic space-time around a black hole, Miller finds, neutron stars rapidly lose angular momentum, which ripples away as gravitational waves. \"Even a small loss of angular momentum will lead to a rapid plunge,\" he says, so black holes gulp down neutron stars under almost all circumstances, even when the black hole is spinning rapidly in the same direction as the neutron star's orbit.<br  /><br  />Miller doesn't know what happens around a black hole spinning as fast as it can. That would require extremely difficult \"full general relativistic numerical calculations with no approximations.\" Still, he concludes, \"It appears possible that no plausible combination of neutron star and black hole masses, spins, and orbital inclinations will result in an accretion disk or stable mass transfer.\"<br  /><br  />Rasio finds the relativistic results far more realistic. \"For the first time ever, this paper gives, in my opinion, a correct description of the final fate of these mergers. This would imply no gamma-ray burst from such a merger, in contrast to many previous speculations.\"<br  /><br  />The gravitational-wave signal would also be different, Rasio tells Astronomy. \"The inspiral [chirp] signal would simply end without any dramatic signature corresponding to the final merger.\""

      "summary": "A new study reveals that the amount of X-rays from magnetar SGR 1745-2900 is dropping more slowly than other previously observed magnetars, and its surface is hotter than expected.",
      "content": "November 1, 2007<br  />Using two NASA satellites, astronomers have discovered a black hole that obliterates a record announced just two weeks ago. The new black hole, with a mass 24 to 33 times that of our Sun, is the heftiest known black hole that orbits another star.<br  /><br  />The record-breaker belongs to the category of \"stellar-mass\" black holes. Formed in the death throes of massive stars, they are smaller than the monster black holes found in galactic cores. The previous record holder for largest stellar-mass black hole is a 16-solar-mass black hole in the galaxy M33, announced on October 17.<br  /><br  />\"We weren't expecting to find a stellar-mass black hole this massive,\" says Andrea Prestwich of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass., lead author of the paper. \"We now know that black holes that form from dying stars can be much larger than we had realized.\"<br  />The black hole is located in the nearby dwarf galaxy IC 10, 1.8 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Cassiopeia. Prestwich's team could measure the black hole's mass because it has an orbiting companion: a hot, highly evolved star. The star is ejecting gas in the form of a wind. Some of this material spirals toward the black hole, heats up, and gives off powerful X-rays before crossing the point of no return.<br  /><br  />In November 2006, Prestwich and her colleagues observed the dwarf galaxy with NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. The group discovered that the galaxy's brightest X-ray source, IC 10 X-1, exhibits sharp changes in X-ray brightness. Such behavior suggests a star periodically passing in front of a companion black hole and blocking the X-rays, creating an eclipse.<br  /><br  />In late November, NASA's Swift satellite confirmed the eclipses and revealed details about the star's orbit. The star in IC 10 X-1 appears to orbit in a plane that lies nearly on the edge to Earth's line of sight. A simple application of Kepler's Laws show that the companion black hole has a mass of at least 24 Suns.<br  /><br  />There are still some uncertainties in the black hole's mass estimate, but as Prestwich notes, \"Future optical observations will provide a final check. Any refinements in the IC 10 X-1 measurement are likely to increase the black hole's mass rather than reduce it.\"<br  /><br  />The black hole's large mass is surprising because massive stars generate powerful winds that blow off many Suns worth of gas before the stars explode. Calculations suggest massive stars in our galaxy leave behind black holes no heavier than about 15 Suns.<br  /><br  />The IC 10 X-1 black hole has gained mass since its birth by gobbling up gas from its companion star, but the rate is so slow that the black hole would have gained no more than 1 or 2 solar masses. \"This black hole was born fat; it didn't grow fat,\" says astrophysicist Richard Mushotzky of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who is not a member of the discovery team.<br  /><br  />The progenitor star probably started its life with 60 or more solar masses. Like its host galaxy, it was probably deficient in elements heavier than hydrogen and helium. In massive, luminous stars with a high fraction of heavy elements, the extra electrons of elements such as carbon and oxygen \"feel\" the outward pressure of light and are more susceptible to being swept away in stellar winds. But with its low fraction of heavy elements, the IC 10 X-1 progenitor shed comparatively little mass before it exploded, so it could leave behind a heavier black hole.<br  /><br  />\"Massive stars in our galaxy today are probably not producing very heavy stellar-mass black holes like this one,\" says co-author Roy Kilgard of Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn. \"But there could be millions of heavy stellar-mass black holes lurking out there that were produced early in the Milky Way's history, before it had a chance to build up heavy elements.\""

      "content": "February 26, 2007<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0A team of astronomers led by Carl Grillmair of the Spitzer Science Center and David Charbonneau of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics announced today that they have directly measured the first spectrum from a known planet orbiting a distant star. Two other teams made a similar measurement of a different extrasolar planet. Taken together, this pioneering work opens a new field of planetary exploration, allowing astronomers to directly analyze the atmospheres of worlds beyond our solar system.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0In a sense, we're getting our first sniffs of air from an alien world,\" says Charbonneau. \"And what we found surprised us.

It orbits a star slightly cooler and less massive than the Sun located about 60 light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Vulpecula. It is the closest known \"transiting\" planet to Earth.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0HD 189733b is a type of planet known as a \"hot Jupiter.\" It orbits very close to its star, completing one revolution every 2.2 days. Its mass and physical size are both slightly larger than Jupiter. At a distance of only three million miles from its star, HD 189733b is heated to a broiling temperature of 1700 degrees Fahrenheit.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0HD 189733b was selected for study because it periodically crosses in front of and behind its star. When transiting in front, the planet partially eclipses the star and blocks a small portion of the star's light. Similarly, the system dims slightly when the planet disappears behind its star since the star blocks the planet's light. By observing this \"secondary eclipse,\" astronomers can tease out the faint signal of the planet from the overwhelming light of the nearby star.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The team studied HD 189733b using the Infrared Spectrograph instrument aboard NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.

However, the fingerprint of water was missing from HD 189733b. Astronomers also expected a prominent signature of methane, but that was missing as well.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"The most fundamental thing we predicted was wrong,\" says Grillmair.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Since planet formation works the same way everywhere, and since the molecules in question should be just as abundant on a distant world orbiting a Sun-like star as they are in our solar system, astronomers speculate that something is hiding the molecules from sight.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0One clue comes from the spectrum of a second planet, HD 209458b, which orbits a different star. That spectrum, obtained by a team led by Jeremy Richardson (NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center), shows hints of silicates — molecules containing silicon and oxygen. Such molecules form rocks on the Earth, but on the scorching-hot worlds studied with Spitzer, silicates exist as tiny dust grains that can form clouds.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"We think that both planets may be cloaked in dark silicate clouds,\" says Charbonneau. \"These worlds are blacker than any planet in our solar system.\"<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The best way to clear up the mystery is to study additional \"hot Jupiters\" to determine if they show similar signs in their atmospheres.

Planets are thought to form early in a star’s history, however, and in 2014 a team led by Vanessa Bailey at the University of Arizona discovered a planet HD 106906b around the star weighing a hefty 11 times Jupiter’s mass and located in the star’s distant suburbs, an astounding 650 AU from the star — one AU is the average distance between Earth and the Sun, or 93 million miles.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Planets were not thought to form so far from their star and its surrounding protoplanetary disk so some suggested that the planet formed much like a star by condensing from its own swirling cloud of gas and dust. The GPI and Hubble discovery of a lopsided comet belt and possible ring around the planet points instead to a normal formation within the debris disk around the star, but a violent episode that forced it into a more distant orbit.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Kalas and a multi-institutional team using GPI first targeted the star in search of other planets in May 2015 and discovered that it was surrounded by a ring of dusty material very close to the size of our own solar system’s Kuiper Belt. The emptiness of the central region — an area about 50 AU in radius, slightly larger than the region occupied by planets in our solar system — indicates that a planetary system has formed there, Kalas said.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0He immediately reanalyzed existing images of the star taken earlier by the Hubble Space Telescope and discovered that the ring of dusty material extended much farther away and was extremely lopsided.

The planet is also unusual in that its orbit is possibly tilted 21° away from the plane of the inner planetary system, whereas most planets typically lie close to a common plane.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Kalas and collaborators hypothesized that the planet may have originated from a position closer to the comet belt, and it may have captured dusty material that still orbits the planet. To test the hypothesis, they carefully analyzed the GPI and Hubble observations, revealing three properties about the planet consistent with a large dusty ring or shroud surrounding it. However, for each of the three properties, alternate explanations are possible.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The investigators will be pursuing more sensitive observations with the Hubble Space Telescope to determine if HD 106906b is in fact one of the first exoplanets that resembles Saturn and its ring system.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The inner belt of dust around the star has been confirmed by an independent team using the planet-finding instrument SPHERE on the ESO’s Very Large Telescope in Chile. The lopsided nature of the debris disk was not evident, however, until Kalas called up archival images from Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The GPI Exoplanet Survey, operated by a team of astronomers at UC Berkeley and 23 other institutions, is targeting 600 young stars, all less than approximately 100 million years old, to understand how planetary systems evolve over time and what planetary dynamics could shape the final arrangement of planets like we see in our solar system today."

      "content": "For centuries, the solar system was viewed as a standard blueprint for planetary systems in the universe, with a star (our Sun) at the center of a circular track, and a planet orbiting within each lane. Smaller rockier planets fill the interior lanes, and larger gas giants orbit further out.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0But over the last 20 years, more powerful telescopes have revealed far from our solar system a host of exotic systems with completely unexpected configurations. \"Hot Jupiters,\" for example, are massive \"roaster\" planets that circle scorchingly close to their stars. Scientists have puzzled over how these gas giants, which supposedly form far from their stars, end up on such blistering orbits.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Now an even weirder planetary system may render the puzzle more challenging. Using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, the Space Telescope Science Institute, the University of California at Santa Cruz, and elsewhere have observed an exoplanet by the name of HD 80606 b. This planet is about the size of Jupiter, though four times as massive, and resides in a system 190 light-years from Earth in the constellation Ursa Major.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0What makes HD 80606 b stand out amid the hundreds of exoplanets discovered recently is its highly eccentric orbit. Instead of maintaining a circular path, HD 80606 b spends about 100 days of its year traveling an oblong route away from and then returning toward its star, much like the trajectory of a comet. Then, in a matter of just 20 hours, it sweeps around the star, very nearly touching it, before swinging away again. At its closest approach, the planet receives an enormous amount of energy from its star — over a thousand times the energy Earth receives from the Sun each day.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"If the Earth were to be moved that close to our Sun, it wouldn't take long for it to lose its atmosphere and turn its surface to magma,\" said Julien de Wit from MIT.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0De Wit and his colleagues report on observations of HD 80606 b over 85 hours, during its closest approach to its star. The researchers have studied how the planet's temperature changes as it approaches, sweeps by, and moves away from its star. They determined that while the star-facing side of the planet boils up to an extreme 2,000° Fahrenheit (1,100° Celsius) during the swingby, these roasting temperatures are short-lived. Surprisingly, they found that the planet cools in fewer than 10 hours as it orbits away, reaching temperatures so cold that it becomes invisible to Spitzer for the rest of its orbit.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"This happens every 111 days,\" de Wit said. \"The good thing is the planet goes so far away that the process is a complete reset. It's the same story over and over again.\"<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0An eccentric perspective<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0It's thought that hot Jupiters start out in circular orbits similar to that of our own Jupiter, far away from their stars. At some point, something large and massive like a nearby star pushes them into eccentric orbits. These planets are then squeezed by their stars' gravity every time they whip close by. During every close encounter, a fraction of the gravitational energy used to squeeze the planets is dissipated as heat, slowly reducing the eccentricity of the planets' orbits, which eventually end up tight and circular — a process known as circularization. HD 80606 b, therefore, is thought to be mid-migration, slowing moving from an elliptical to a circular track.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0How long the circularization phase lasts depends on how \"squishy\" or pliable the planet is, given its interior properties. The more pliable a planet, the better it is at dissipating mechanical energy as heat — a trick anyone can experience by repeatedly squeezing a rubber ball, which in turn heats up the ball. Based on the squishiness of the giants in our solar system, the circularization phase is expected to occur over a relatively short period of hundreds of millions of years. Scientists believe this mechanism might explain how hot Jupiters eventually evolved their close-in orbits.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0However, the new Spitzer observations suggest that HD 80606 b is not as squishy as expected. Therefore, HD 80606 b is not migrating as fast as previously thought and may maintain its highly eccentric orbit for another 10 billion years or more. If this is the case, de Wit said scientists may have to rethink theories on how hot Jupiters are formed, as it implies that the underlying migration mechanism may not be as efficient as once believed.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0De Wit said that alternative theories for how hot Jupiters form — in which gas giants develop close to their stars or smoothly spiral inward with the help of planet-forming disks — may be more likely explanations for hot Jupiter evolution.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The researchers also calculated the planet's rotation rate. HD 80606 b's rotation rate, essentially the length of its day, is estimated to be 90 hours, which is twice as long as predicted for this planet.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"This system is undoubtedly very unique as it seems to challenge in many ways our understanding of planet-star interactions and planet formation,\" de Wit said. \"Hopefully, future studies of similar systems will help us evaluate how special this system is and how far off our initial theories were.\""

Terrestrial planets are difficult to detect. Most of the methods used so far are indirect and sensitive to the mass of the planet, while COROT can directly measure the size of its surface. In addition, its location in space allows for longer periods of uninterrupted observation than would be possible from the ground.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Recent measurements have indicated planets of small masses exist but their size remained undetermined until now.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The internal structure of COROT-exo-7b puzzles scientists. They are unsure if it is an 'ocean planet' — a kind of planet whose existence has never been proved so far. In theory, such planets would initially be covered partially in ice, and they would later drift towards their star, with the ice melting to cover it in liquid.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"This discovery is a very important step on the road to understanding the formation and evolution of our planet,\" said Malcolm Fridlund, European Space Agency's COROT project scientist. \"For the first time, we have unambiguously detected a planet that is 'rocky' in the same sense as Earth. We now have to understand this object further to put it into context, and continue our search for smaller, more earthlike objects with COROT,\" he said."

The Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) was created in 2004 by relocating the nine 6-meter telescopes of the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) array from Hat Creek, Calif., and the six 10-meter telescopes of Caltech's Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) millimeter-wave array to Cedar Flat. The 15-dish array conducted its first observations in 2006.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The CARMA array observes at millimeter wavelengths, which is ideal for piercing the clouds of dust and gas surrounding young stars to see their dense, dusty disks. Eisner and his colleagues also used the Submillimeter Array (SMA) atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii for this study. The combination of CARMA and the SMA enabled the sensitivity and high image quality needed to observe the dusty disks in Orion.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The astronomers' observations of Orion's central region of more than 250 known stars showed that only about 10 percent emit 1.3-millimeter wavelength radiation typically emitted by a warm disk of dust. Even fewer<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0— less than 8 percent of stars surveyed — were judged to have dust disks with masses greater than one-hundredth the mass of the sun, a mass thought to be the lower limit for formation of Jupiter-sized planets. The average mass of a protoplanetary disk in the region was only one-thousandth of a solar mass, the researchers calculated.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Eisner noted that previous surveys he and Carpenter have conducted of other young, open clusters that are older or younger than Orion show an evolutionary trend in the average masses of disks in the different regions. Older clusters tend to show less dust, perhaps because much of it has already gathered into planets.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Previous surveys of another lower-density, star-forming region — the Taurus cluster — showed that more than 20 percent of its stars have enough mass to form planets. The difference is probably related to the tightly packed, hot stars of the Orion cluster, said Carpenter, a senior research astronomer and deputy director of OVRO.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"Somehow, the Orion cluster environment is not conducive to forming high mass disks or having them survive long, presumably due to the ionization field from the hot, massive OB stars, which you might expect would photoevaporate dust and lead to small disk masses,\" he said.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Many of the stars in Orion imaged by CARMA had been photographed earlier by the Hubble Space Telescope and were dubbed proplyds, short for protoplanetary disks.

Two other teams made a similar measurement of a different extrasolar planet. Taken together, this pioneering work opens a new field of planetary exploration, allowing astronomers to directly analyze the atmospheres of worlds beyond our solar system.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0In a sense, we're getting our first sniffs of air from an alien world,\" says Charbonneau. \"And what we found surprised us.

It orbits a star slightly cooler and less massive than the Sun located about 60 light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Vulpecula. It is the closest known \"transiting\" planet to Earth.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0HD 189733b is a type of planet known as a \"hot Jupiter.\" It orbits very close to its star, completing one revolution every 2.2 days. Its mass and physical size are both slightly larger than Jupiter. At a distance of only three million miles from its star, HD 189733b is heated to a broiling temperature of 1700 degrees Fahrenheit.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0HD 189733b was selected for study because it periodically crosses in front of and behind its star. When transiting in front, the planet partially eclipses the star and blocks a small portion of the star's light. Similarly, the system dims slightly when the planet disappears behind its star since the star blocks the planet's light. By observing this \"secondary eclipse,\" astronomers can tease out the faint signal of the planet from the overwhelming light of the nearby star.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The team studied HD 189733b using the Infrared Spectrograph instrument aboard NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.

However, the fingerprint of water was missing from HD 189733b. Astronomers also expected a prominent signature of methane, but that was missing as well.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"The most fundamental thing we predicted was wrong,\" says Grillmair.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Since planet formation works the same way everywhere, and since the molecules in question should be just as abundant on a distant world orbiting a Sun-like star as they are in our solar system, astronomers speculate that something is hiding the molecules from sight.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0One clue comes from the spectrum of a second planet, HD 209458b, which orbits a different star. That spectrum, obtained by a team led by Jeremy Richardson (NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center), shows hints of silicates — molecules containing silicon and oxygen.

One of the ways, though, is to study these violent episodes of gravitational disturbance around other young stars that kick out many objects, including planets.”<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The disturbance could have been caused by a passing star that perturbed the inner planets or a second massive planet in the system. The GPI team also looked for another large planet closer to the star that may have interacted with the exoplanet but found nothing outside of a Uranus-sized orbit.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Young 13-million-year-old star<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The star, HD 106906, is located 300 light-years away in the direction of the constellation Crux and is similar to the Sun, but much younger — about 13 million years old compared to our Sun’s 4.5 billion years. Planets are thought to form early in a star’s history, however, and in 2014 a team led by Vanessa Bailey at the University of Arizona discovered a planet HD 106906b around the star weighing a hefty 11 times Jupiter’s mass and located in the star’s distant suburbs, an astounding 650 AU from the star — one AU is the average distance between Earth and the Sun, or 93 million miles.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Planets were not thought to form so far from their star and its surrounding protoplanetary disk so some suggested that the planet formed much like a star by condensing from its own swirling cloud of gas and dust. The GPI and Hubble discovery of a lopsided comet belt and possible ring around the planet points instead to a normal formation within the debris disk around the star, but a violent episode that forced it into a more distant orbit.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Kalas and a multi-institutional team using GPI first targeted the star in search of other planets in May 2015 and discovered that it was surrounded by a ring of dusty material very close to the size of our own solar system’s Kuiper Belt. The emptiness of the central region — an area about 50 AU in radius, slightly larger than the region occupied by planets in our solar system — indicates that a planetary system has formed there, Kalas said.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0He immediately reanalyzed existing images of the star taken earlier by the Hubble Space Telescope and discovered that the ring of dusty material extended much farther away and was extremely lopsided. On the side facing the planet, the dusty material was vertically thin and spanned nearly the huge distance to the known planet, but on the opposite side the dusty material was vertically thick and truncated.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0“These discoveries suggest that the entire planetary system has been recently jostled by an unknown perturbation to its current asymmetric state,” he said. The planet is also unusual in that its orbit is possibly tilted 21° away from the plane of the inner planetary system, whereas most planets typically lie close to a common plane.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Kalas and collaborators hypothesized that the planet may have originated from a position closer to the comet belt, and it may have captured dusty material that still orbits the planet. To test the hypothesis, they carefully analyzed the GPI and Hubble observations, revealing three properties about the planet consistent with a large dusty ring or shroud surrounding it. However, for each of the three properties, alternate explanations are possible.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The investigators will be pursuing more sensitive observations with the Hubble Space Telescope to determine if HD 106906b is in fact one of the first exoplanets that resembles Saturn and its ring system.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The inner belt of dust around the star has been confirmed by an independent team using the planet-finding instrument SPHERE on the ESO’s Very Large Telescope in Chile. The lopsided nature of the debris disk was not evident, however, until Kalas called up archival images from Hubble’s Advanced Camera for Surveys.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The GPI Exoplanet Survey, operated by a team of astronomers at UC Berkeley and 23 other institutions, is targeting 600 young stars, all less than approximately 100 million years old, to understand how planetary systems evolve over time and what planetary dynamics could shape the final arrangement of planets like we see in our solar system today."

      "content": "For centuries, the solar system was viewed as a standard blueprint for planetary systems in the universe, with a star (our Sun) at the center of a circular track, and a planet orbiting within each lane. Smaller rockier planets fill the interior lanes, and larger gas giants orbit further out.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0But over the last 20 years, more powerful telescopes have revealed far from our solar system a host of exotic systems with completely unexpected configurations. \"Hot Jupiters,\" for example, are massive \"roaster\" planets that circle scorchingly close to their stars. Scientists have puzzled over how these gas giants, which supposedly form far from their stars, end up on such blistering orbits.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Now an even weirder planetary system may render the puzzle more challenging. Using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, the Space Telescope Science Institute, the University of California at Santa Cruz, and elsewhere have observed an exoplanet by the name of HD 80606 b. This planet is about the size of Jupiter, though four times as massive, and resides in a system 190 light-years from Earth in the constellation Ursa Major.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0What makes HD 80606 b stand out amid the hundreds of exoplanets discovered recently is its highly eccentric orbit. Instead of maintaining a circular path, HD 80606 b spends about 100 days of its year traveling an oblong route away from and then returning toward its star, much like the trajectory of a comet. Then, in a matter of just 20 hours, it sweeps around the star, very nearly touching it, before swinging away again. At its closest approach, the planet receives an enormous amount of energy from its star — over a thousand times the energy Earth receives from the Sun each day.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"If the Earth were to be moved that close to our Sun, it wouldn't take long for it to lose its atmosphere and turn its surface to magma,\" said Julien de Wit from MIT.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0De Wit and his colleagues report on observations of HD 80606 b over 85 hours, during its closest approach to its star. The researchers have studied how the planet's temperature changes as it approaches, sweeps by, and moves away from its star. They determined that while the star-facing side of the planet boils up to an extreme 2,000° Fahrenheit (1,100° Celsius) during the swingby, these roasting temperatures are short-lived. Surprisingly, they found that the planet cools in fewer than 10 hours as it orbits away, reaching temperatures so cold that it becomes invisible to Spitzer for the rest of its orbit.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"This happens every 111 days,\" de Wit said. \"The good thing is the planet goes so far away that the process is a complete reset. It's the same story over and over again.\"<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0An eccentric perspective<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0It's thought that hot Jupiters start out in circular orbits similar to that of our own Jupiter, far away from their stars. At some point, something large and massive like a nearby star pushes them into eccentric orbits. These planets are then squeezed by their stars' gravity every time they whip close by. During every close encounter, a fraction of the gravitational energy used to squeeze the planets is dissipated as heat, slowly reducing the eccentricity of the planets' orbits, which eventually end up tight and circular — a process known as circularization. HD 80606 b, therefore, is thought to be mid-migration, slowing moving from an elliptical to a circular track.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0How long the circularization phase lasts depends on how \"squishy\" or pliable the planet is, given its interior properties. The more pliable a planet, the better it is at dissipating mechanical energy as heat — a trick anyone can experience by repeatedly squeezing a rubber ball, which in turn heats up the ball. Based on the squishiness of the giants in our solar system, the circularization phase is expected to occur over a relatively short period of hundreds of millions of years. Scientists believe this mechanism might explain how hot Jupiters eventually evolved their close-in orbits.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0However, the new Spitzer observations suggest that HD 80606 b is not as squishy as expected. Therefore, HD 80606 b is not migrating as fast as previously thought and may maintain its highly eccentric orbit for another 10 billion years or more. If this is the case, de Wit said scientists may have to rethink theories on how hot Jupiters are formed, as it implies that the underlying migration mechanism may not be as efficient as once believed.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0De Wit said that alternative theories for how hot Jupiters form — in which gas giants develop close to their stars or smoothly spiral inward with the help of planet-forming disks — may be more likely explanations for hot Jupiter evolution.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The researchers also calculated the planet's rotation rate. HD 80606 b's rotation rate, essentially the length of its day, is estimated to be 90 hours, which is twice as long as predicted for this planet.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"This system is undoubtedly very unique as it seems to challenge in many ways our understanding of planet-star interactions and planet formation,\" de Wit said. \"Hopefully, future studies of similar systems will help us evaluate how special this system is and how far off our initial theories were.\""

The Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) was created in 2004 by relocating the nine 6-meter telescopes of the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) array from Hat Creek, Calif., and the six 10-meter telescopes of Caltech's Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) millimeter-wave array to Cedar Flat.

While Hubble saw the dust disks silhouetted against the star, CARMA directly detected emissions from the dust itself.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"CARMA is an ideal instrument for this type of study, with its 15 telescopes providing the fine resolution needed to resolve protoplanetary disks so that we can determine their structure and measure their masses more precisely,\" Eisner said.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Carpenter noted that future improvements to the CARMA array could allow detection of even smaller disks capable of giving rise to sub-Jupiter planets. To detect even smaller disks able to form large Earth-like planets, or super-Earths, will require a more extensive array, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) now being built in Chile."

Two other teams made a similar measurement of a different extrasolar planet. Taken together, this pioneering work opens a new field of planetary exploration, allowing astronomers to directly analyze the atmospheres of worlds beyond our solar system.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0In a sense, we're getting our first sniffs of air from an alien world,\" says Charbonneau. \"And what we found surprised us.

It orbits a star slightly cooler and less massive than the Sun located about 60 light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Vulpecula. It is the closest known \"transiting\" planet to Earth.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0HD 189733b is a type of planet known as a \"hot Jupiter.\" It orbits very close to its star, completing one revolution every 2.2 days. Its mass and physical size are both slightly larger than Jupiter. At a distance of only three million miles from its star, HD 189733b is heated to a broiling temperature of 1700 degrees Fahrenheit.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0HD 189733b was selected for study because it periodically crosses in front of and behind its star. When transiting in front, the planet partially eclipses the star and blocks a small portion of the star's light. Similarly, the system dims slightly when the planet disappears behind its star since the star blocks the planet's light. By observing this \"secondary eclipse,\" astronomers can tease out the faint signal of the planet from the overwhelming light of the nearby star.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The team studied HD 189733b using the Infrared Spectrograph instrument aboard NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.

However, the fingerprint of water was missing from HD 189733b.

That spectrum, obtained by a team led by Jeremy Richardson (NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center), shows hints of silicates — molecules containing silicon and oxygen. Such molecules form rocks on the Earth, but on the scorching-hot worlds studied with Spitzer, silicates exist as tiny dust grains that can form clouds.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"We think that both planets may be cloaked in dark silicate clouds,\" says Charbonneau. \"These worlds are blacker than any planet in our solar system.\"<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The best way to clear up the mystery is to study additional \"hot Jupiters\" to determine if they show similar signs in their atmospheres.

One of the ways, though, is to study these violent episodes of gravitational disturbance around other young stars that kick out many objects, including planets.”<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The disturbance could have been caused by a passing star that perturbed the inner planets or a second massive planet in the system.

Planets are thought to form early in a star’s history, however, and in 2014 a team led by Vanessa Bailey at the University of Arizona discovered a planet HD 106906b around the star weighing a hefty 11 times Jupiter’s mass and located in the star’s distant suburbs, an astounding 650 AU from the star — one AU is the average distance between Earth and the Sun, or 93 million miles.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Planets were not thought to form so far from their star and its surrounding protoplanetary disk so some suggested that the planet formed much like a star by condensing from its own swirling cloud of gas and dust. The GPI and Hubble discovery of a lopsided comet belt and possible ring around the planet points instead to a normal formation within the debris disk around the star, but a violent episode that forced it into a more distant orbit.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Kalas and a multi-institutional team using GPI first targeted the star in search of other planets in May 2015 and discovered that it was surrounded by a ring of dusty material very close to the size of our own solar system’s Kuiper Belt. The emptiness of the central region — an area about 50 AU in radius, slightly larger than the region occupied by planets in our solar system — indicates that a planetary system has formed there, Kalas said.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0He immediately reanalyzed existing images of the star taken earlier by the Hubble Space Telescope and discovered that the ring of dusty material extended much farther away and was extremely lopsided.

The planet is also unusual in that its orbit is possibly tilted 21° away from the plane of the inner planetary system, whereas most planets typically lie close to a common plane.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Kalas and collaborators hypothesized that the planet may have originated from a position closer to the comet belt, and it may have captured dusty material that still orbits the planet.

However, for each of the three properties, alternate explanations are possible.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The investigators will be pursuing more sensitive observations with the Hubble Space Telescope to determine if HD 106906b is in fact one of the first exoplanets that resembles Saturn and its ring system.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The inner belt of dust around the star has been confirmed by an independent team using the planet-finding instrument SPHERE on the ESO’s Very Large Telescope in Chile.

      "content": "For centuries, the solar system was viewed as a standard blueprint for planetary systems in the universe, with a star (our Sun) at the center of a circular track, and a planet orbiting within each lane. Smaller rockier planets fill the interior lanes, and larger gas giants orbit further out.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0But over the last 20 years, more powerful telescopes have revealed far from our solar system a host of exotic systems with completely unexpected configurations. \"Hot Jupiters,\" for example, are massive \"roaster\" planets that circle scorchingly close to their stars. Scientists have puzzled over how these gas giants, which supposedly form far from their stars, end up on such blistering orbits.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Now an even weirder planetary system may render the puzzle more challenging. Using NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, the Space Telescope Science Institute, the University of California at Santa Cruz, and elsewhere have observed an exoplanet by the name of HD 80606 b. This planet is about the size of Jupiter, though four times as massive, and resides in a system 190 light-years from Earth in the constellation Ursa Major.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0What makes HD 80606 b stand out amid the hundreds of exoplanets discovered recently is its highly eccentric orbit. Instead of maintaining a circular path, HD 80606 b spends about 100 days of its year traveling an oblong route away from and then returning toward its star, much like the trajectory of a comet. Then, in a matter of just 20 hours, it sweeps around the star, very nearly touching it, before swinging away again. At its closest approach, the planet receives an enormous amount of energy from its star — over a thousand times the energy Earth receives from the Sun each day.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"If the Earth were to be moved that close to our Sun, it wouldn't take long for it to lose its atmosphere and turn its surface to magma,\" said Julien de Wit from MIT.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0De Wit and his colleagues report on observations of HD 80606 b over 85 hours, during its closest approach to its star. The researchers have studied how the planet's temperature changes as it approaches, sweeps by, and moves away from its star. They determined that while the star-facing side of the planet boils up to an extreme 2,000° Fahrenheit (1,100° Celsius) during the swingby, these roasting temperatures are short-lived. Surprisingly, they found that the planet cools in fewer than 10 hours as it orbits away, reaching temperatures so cold that it becomes invisible to Spitzer for the rest of its orbit.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"This happens every 111 days,\" de Wit said. \"The good thing is the planet goes so far away that the process is a complete reset. It's the same story over and over again.\"<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0An eccentric perspective<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0It's thought that hot Jupiters start out in circular orbits similar to that of our own Jupiter, far away from their stars. At some point, something large and massive like a nearby star pushes them into eccentric orbits. These planets are then squeezed by their stars' gravity every time they whip close by. During every close encounter, a fraction of the gravitational energy used to squeeze the planets is dissipated as heat, slowly reducing the eccentricity of the planets' orbits, which eventually end up tight and circular — a process known as circularization. HD 80606 b, therefore, is thought to be mid-migration, slowing moving from an elliptical to a circular track.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0How long the circularization phase lasts depends on how \"squishy\" or pliable the planet is, given its interior properties. The more pliable a planet, the better it is at dissipating mechanical energy as heat — a trick anyone can experience by repeatedly squeezing a rubber ball, which in turn heats up the ball. Based on the squishiness of the giants in our solar system, the circularization phase is expected to occur over a relatively short period of hundreds of millions of years. Scientists believe this mechanism might explain how hot Jupiters eventually evolved their close-in orbits.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0However, the new Spitzer observations suggest that HD 80606 b is not as squishy as expected. Therefore, HD 80606 b is not migrating as fast as previously thought and may maintain its highly eccentric orbit for another 10 billion years or more. If this is the case, de Wit said scientists may have to rethink theories on how hot Jupiters are formed, as it implies that the underlying migration mechanism may not be as efficient as once believed.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0De Wit said that alternative theories for how hot Jupiters form — in which gas giants develop close to their stars or smoothly spiral inward with the help of planet-forming disks — may be more likely explanations for hot Jupiter evolution.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The researchers also calculated the planet's rotation rate. HD 80606 b's rotation rate, essentially the length of its day, is estimated to be 90 hours, which is twice as long as predicted for this planet.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"This system is undoubtedly very unique as it seems to challenge in many ways our understanding of planet-star interactions and planet formation,\" de Wit said. \"Hopefully, future studies of similar systems will help us evaluate how special this system is and how far off our initial theories were.\""

The Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) was created in 2004 by relocating the nine 6-meter telescopes of the Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland Association (BIMA) array from Hat Creek, Calif., and the six 10-meter telescopes of Caltech's Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) millimeter-wave array to Cedar Flat.

Eisner and his colleagues also used the Submillimeter Array (SMA) atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii for this study. The combination of CARMA and the SMA enabled the sensitivity and high image quality needed to observe the dusty disks in Orion.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0The astronomers' observations of Orion's central region of more than 250 known stars showed that only about 10 percent emit 1.3-millimeter wavelength radiation typically emitted by a warm disk of dust. Even fewer<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0— less than 8 percent of stars surveyed — were judged to have dust disks with masses greater than one-hundredth the mass of the sun, a mass thought to be the lower limit for formation of Jupiter-sized planets. The average mass of a protoplanetary disk in the region was only one-thousandth of a solar mass, the researchers calculated.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Eisner noted that previous surveys he and Carpenter have conducted of other young, open clusters that are older or younger than Orion show an evolutionary trend in the average masses of disks in the different regions.

The difference is probably related to the tightly packed, hot stars of the Orion cluster, said Carpenter, a senior research astronomer and deputy director of OVRO.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\"Somehow, the Orion cluster environment is not conducive to forming high mass disks or having them survive long, presumably due to the ionization field from the hot, massive OB stars, which you might expect would photoevaporate dust and lead to small disk masses,\" he said.<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0<br />\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0Many of the stars in Orion imaged by CARMA had been photographed earlier by the Hubble Space Telescope and were dubbed proplyds, short for protoplanetary disks.

To detect even smaller disks able to form large Earth-like planets, or super-Earths, will require a more extensive array, such as the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) now being built in Chile."

      "content": "Do barred galaxies have two or more supermassive black holes in the central region? Can a single black hole in the center create a bar?<br  /><br  />Nicolas Andreyev <br  />Estes Park, Colorado <br  /><br  /><br  /><br  />Barred spiral galaxies are fairly common throughout the universe — at least one-third to one-half of spiral galaxies show some kind of central bar structure, including our own Milky Way. Because bars form in the centers of galaxies, which is also where supermassive black holes reside, it’s easy to think the two are connected. However, the gravitational influence of a galaxy’s supermassive black hole is so limited that it has nothing to do with how or why a central bar forms.<br  /><br  />But, you may be saying, supermassive black holes contain millions or billions of Suns’ worth of mass. How can such a massive object not be related to the central bar? There are two main reasons: First, the influence of an object’s gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance you are from that object. This is a complicated way of saying that the gravitational pull you feel from something very quickly becomes weaker as you move away from it. So, given that the bulge of, say, the Milky Way stretches nearly 7,000 light-years across, the sphere of influence around its supermassive black hole is not nearly large enough to dictate the motions of material throughout the entire bulge. The second reason is that the mass of a galaxy’s bulge itself — the stars and gas — far outweighs that of its supermassive black hole. The difference is quite extreme: The average supermassive black hole accounts for only about 0.5 percent of the total mass in a galaxy’s bulge. <br  /><br  />So, despite its location, a supermassive black hole has nothing to do with the formation of a bar structure. Even the acquisition of an additional supermassive black hole from a colliding galaxy could not create a bar — such an event might, in fact, disrupt one. Galactic bars are instead caused by gravitational instabilities in the motion of material in a galaxy’s bulge. Because the material throughout a galaxy is not distributed evenly, instabilities arise in areas that start out slightly denser than their surroundings, causing them to attract more material. Given time, the orbits of numerous stars and gas clouds will overlap, creating the structure we see. This is similar to the way spiral arms are generated as density waves cause material in a galaxy’s disk to pile up in certain orbits like a traffic jam as the galaxy rotates. And although a bar or spiral arms may look solid, they are really just dense regions where more material is present. Their shape, size, and even existence can change within a single galaxy over its lifetime. <br  /><br  />Alison Klesman <br  />Senior Associate Editor"

      "content": "A popular old saying claims, “Absence makes the heart grow fonder.” For me, this describes my love of the southern sky. I’ve spent maybe 50 nights total under it, but each one has been filled with discovery and fascination.<br  /><br  />For this story, I’ve chosen deep-sky objects in the far south — within 30° of the South Celestial Pole. Once you point a telescope toward that region, you’ll encounter constellations you may not be familiar with: Apus, Ara, Carina, Centaurus, Circinus, Crux, Dorado, Horologium, Hydrus, Indus, Mensa, Musca, Octans, Pictor, Reticulum, Triangulum Australe, Tucana, and Volans. And although Carina, Centaurus, and Crux contain bright stars you can navigate by, luminaries in the other groups are few and far between.<br  /><br  />What are the best locations to view these southern wonders? One is the tip of South America, either in Chile or Argentina. From a latitude of 50° south, the South Celestial Pole stands 50° high, so the objects in this story will never set. Instead, they’ll lie between 20° and 80° above the horizon all night.<br  /><br  />But let’s say you’re heading to Melbourne, Australia. From there, targets on this list will appear about 12° lower. Your best views from either location will come when an object stands highest above the horizon.<br  /><br  />I’ve listed these objects in order of right ascension. Pick one that’s high in the sky, and the subsequent objects will rise to their highest points after it. Good luck!<br  /><br  />The list<br  />As it happens, our first target is one of the best: 47 Tucanae (NGC 104). This globular cluster forms a celestial pairing in Tucana with the Small Magellanic Cloud — both objects are easily visible to the naked eye. Among globulars, only Omega Centauri (NGC 5139) outshines NGC 104.<br  /><br  />To the naked eye, 47 Tucanae appears as a magnitude 3.8 fuzzy “star.” A 3-inch telescope will begin to resolve this cluster’s stars, but they really put on a show when you use an 8-inch or larger scope. Through such instruments, the cluster is a 50'-wide ball of stars you can resolve nearly to the core. Be sure to note the many streams of stars that emanate from its central region 6' in diameter.<br  /><br  />Our second target, bright globular cluster NGC 362, lies in Tucana on the northern edge of the Small Magellanic Cloud. It’s not part of that galaxy, however, and sits seven times closer to us.<br  /><br  />Sharp-eyed observers will see it without optical aid as a magnitude 6.5, extended “star.” Its apparent diameter is 12.9', more than 40 percent that of the Full Moon. Through an 8-inch telescope, NGC 362 explodes with detail. Well, except for the core — you’ll need a larger scope and high magnification to resolve any of the stars near the cluster’s center.<br  /><br  />Our next object is a true southern showpiece. NGC 1313 sits in the southwest corner of Reticulum, 3.2° southwest of magnitude 3.8 Beta (β) Reticuli. This spiral galaxy glows at magnitude 8.9 and measures 11.0' by 7.6'."

      "summary": "An ultra-rare merger of three galaxies, two of which host active black holes, is teaching us more about how galaxies grow.",
      "content": "Galaxies are constantly colliding, merging, and creating ever-larger structures. That’s true of the Milky Way, too. Our home galaxy has devoured multiple smaller galaxies in its past. And one day, about 4.5 billion years from now, the Milky Way will also merge with the nearby Andromeda Galaxy.<br  /><br  />Astronomers study this cannibalistic cycle, called the hierarchical model of galaxy evolution, by catching distant galaxies in the act of smashing together. And when galaxies merge, so do their central supermassive black holes, which each weigh millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun. During this process, gas, dust, and stars dislodged by the collision can be either flung outward and away from the merging galaxies or inward toward their cores. In the latter case, the resulting influx of material can rapidly feed the supermassive black holes, forming bright, energetic accretion disks around them. That turns them into what astronomers call active galactic nuclei or AGN.<br  /><br  />Now, researchers have spotted a triple galaxy merger — three separate galaxies slamming together at once — in which two of the three galaxies appear to sport an AGN. This sight is incredibly rare, and astronomers know of fewer than 10 such triple mergers with dual AGN. Two of the merging galaxies appear close together, with a third galaxy (this one a smaller dwarf galaxy) to their north.<br  /><br  />Researchers think the dwarf may have already passed through the other two galaxies, disrupting all three as they swirl together. A tail of dust and gas connecting the dwarf to the other two is visible in images, which helps astronomers trace back the galaxies’ interactions thus far.<br  /><br  />Mixed signals<br  /><br  />The two larger, closer galaxies have central cores that are a mere 9,100 light-years apart. That’s only about one-third the Sun’s distance to the center of our Milky Way Galaxy. Curious about what was going on in these cores, astronomers used several observatories to peer at them in different wavelengths, including radio, infrared, optical, and X-ray light.<br  /><br  />They discovered that the two close cores are each emitting bright optical light and X-rays indicating activity from an AGN. But one core shows stronger AGN signals than the other, while both are missing some key signs of AGN activity.<br  /><br  />“Mergers are messy. Black holes start turning on, showing AGN behavior, and turn off again — and dust and gas can obscure what we see,” explained Johnathan Williams of the University of Maryland, who led the study, during a virtual press conference Monday at the 238th meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Such obscuring material, he said, could explain why the cores look like AGN at some wavelengths of light, but not others. He went on to add that better understanding this system can teach astronomers how and why AGN might turn on and off during a merger, such as when there is gas and dust in their vicinity.<br  /><br  />End result<br  /><br  />Exactly how supermassive black holes ultimately come together during a galaxy merger is still a bit of a mystery. But it’s one that researchers hope to soon solve, when future gravitational-wave observatories capable of “hearing” such events come online. “Knowing how often such mergers take place will help us know what to look for, and when we’re seeing something unexpected,” Williams said.<br  /><br  />For now, astronomers can only study rare examples such as this in the hopes of disentangling them. In the case of this system, Williams said, models indicate the third core might eventually be ejected altogether, which could cause the two closer cores to merge faster than they might have otherwise. The team next plans to observe this triple merger with the Hubble Space Telescope to uncover more clues.<br  /><br  />“This system combines an usual combination of features, some puzzling aspects, and the potential to answer a number of questions about AGN and galaxy mergers,” Williams concluded. “Work is ongoing and one thing is certain: More surprises lay in store.”"

      "content": "Do barred galaxies have two or more supermassive black holes in the central region? Can a single black hole in the center create a bar?<br  /><br  />Nicolas Andreyev <br  />Estes Park, Colorado <br  /><br  /><br  /><br  />Barred spiral galaxies are fairly common throughout the universe — at least one-third to one-half of spiral galaxies show some kind of central bar structure, including our own Milky Way. Because bars form in the centers of galaxies, which is also where supermassive black holes reside, it’s easy to think the two are connected. However, the gravitational influence of a galaxy’s supermassive black hole is so limited that it has nothing to do with how or why a central bar forms.<br  /><br  />But, you may be saying, supermassive black holes contain millions or billions of Suns’ worth of mass. How can such a massive object not be related to the central bar? There are two main reasons: First, the influence of an object’s gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance you are from that object. This is a complicated way of saying that the gravitational pull you feel from something very quickly becomes weaker as you move away from it. So, given that the bulge of, say, the Milky Way stretches nearly 7,000 light-years across, the sphere of influence around its supermassive black hole is not nearly large enough to dictate the motions of material throughout the entire bulge. The second reason is that the mass of a galaxy’s bulge itself — the stars and gas — far outweighs that of its supermassive black hole. The difference is quite extreme: The average supermassive black hole accounts for only about 0.5 percent of the total mass in a galaxy’s bulge. <br  /><br  />So, despite its location, a supermassive black hole has nothing to do with the formation of a bar structure. Even the acquisition of an additional supermassive black hole from a colliding galaxy could not create a bar — such an event might, in fact, disrupt one. Galactic bars are instead caused by gravitational instabilities in the motion of material in a galaxy’s bulge. Because the material throughout a galaxy is not distributed evenly, instabilities arise in areas that start out slightly denser than their surroundings, causing them to attract more material. Given time, the orbits of numerous stars and gas clouds will overlap, creating the structure we see. This is similar to the way spiral arms are generated as density waves cause material in a galaxy’s disk to pile up in certain orbits like a traffic jam as the galaxy rotates. And although a bar or spiral arms may look solid, they are really just dense regions where more material is present. Their shape, size, and even existence can change within a single galaxy over its lifetime. <br  /><br  />Alison Klesman <br  />Senior Associate Editor"

Our home galaxy has devoured multiple smaller galaxies in its past. And one day, about 4.5 billion years from now, the Milky Way will also merge with the nearby Andromeda Galaxy.<br  /><br  />Astronomers study this cannibalistic cycle, called the hierarchical model of galaxy evolution, by catching distant galaxies in the act of smashing together. And when galaxies merge, so do their central supermassive black holes, which each weigh millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun. During this process, gas, dust, and stars dislodged by the collision can be either flung outward and away from the merging galaxies or inward toward their cores. In the latter case, the resulting influx of material can rapidly feed the supermassive black holes, forming bright, energetic accretion disks around them. That turns them into what astronomers call active galactic nuclei or AGN.<br  /><br  />Now, researchers have spotted a triple galaxy merger — three separate galaxies slamming together at once — in which two of the three galaxies appear to sport an AGN. This sight is incredibly rare, and astronomers know of fewer than 10 such triple mergers with dual AGN. Two of the merging galaxies appear close together, with a third galaxy (this one a smaller dwarf galaxy) to their north.<br  /><br  />Researchers think the dwarf may have already passed through the other two galaxies, disrupting all three as they swirl together. A tail of dust and gas connecting the dwarf to the other two is visible in images, which helps astronomers trace back the galaxies’ interactions thus far.<br  /><br  />Mixed signals<br  /><br  />The two larger, closer galaxies have central cores that are a mere 9,100 light-years apart.

Curious about what was going on in these cores, astronomers used several observatories to peer at them in different wavelengths, including radio, infrared, optical, and X-ray light.<br  /><br  />They discovered that the two close cores are each emitting bright optical light and X-rays indicating activity from an AGN. But one core shows stronger AGN signals than the other, while both are missing some key signs of AGN activity.<br  /><br  />“Mergers are messy. Black holes start turning on, showing AGN behavior, and turn off again — and dust and gas can obscure what we see,” explained Johnathan Williams of the University of Maryland, who led the study, during a virtual press conference Monday at the 238th meeting of the American Astronomical Society. Such obscuring material, he said, could explain why the cores look like AGN at some wavelengths of light, but not others. He went on to add that better understanding this system can teach astronomers how and why AGN might turn on and off during a merger, such as when there is gas and dust in their vicinity.<br  /><br  />End result<br  /><br  />Exactly how supermassive black holes ultimately come together during a galaxy merger is still a bit of a mystery. But it’s one that researchers hope to soon solve, when future gravitational-wave observatories capable of “hearing” such events come online. “Knowing how often such mergers take place will help us know what to look for, and when we’re seeing something unexpected,” Williams said.<br  /><br  />For now, astronomers can only study rare examples such as this in the hopes of disentangling them. In the case of this system, Williams said, models indicate the third core might eventually be ejected altogether, which could cause the two closer cores to merge faster than they might have otherwise. The team next plans to observe this triple merger with the Hubble Space Telescope to uncover more clues.<br  /><br  />“This system combines an usual combination of features, some puzzling aspects, and the potential to answer a number of questions about AGN and galaxy mergers,” Williams concluded. “Work is ongoing and one thing is certain: More surprises lay in store.”"

The intense star formation might be due to a collision between NGC 2276 and another dwarf galaxy many eons ago.<br  /><br  />NGC 2276 is a perfect example of the physics of the cosmos. Nothing is uniform in space, but it sure is sweet to look at."

      "content": "The curling, wispy arms in this image might belong to the earliest spiral galaxy yet discovered. The graceful galaxy is seen as it existed just 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang. That’s over a billion years older than the previous record holder for a spiral galaxy.<br  /><br  />This ancient specimen was discovered by Takfumi Tsukui and Satoru Iguchi at the Sokendai university in Tokyo using the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) radio telescope in Chile.<br  /><br  />The galaxy, called BRI 1335-0417, appears to display a central bulge, a rotating gas disk, and spiral arms. Based on analysis of the galaxy’s spectra, it’s also pumping out newborn stars at a prodigious rate — 5,000 Suns’ worth per year. This makes it a so-called starburst galaxy.<br  /><br  />The above traits are all hallmarks of a young spiral galaxy entering its prime. Spiral arms are thought to be the result of waves of star formation that spread through a young galaxy's disk. But scientists had never before seen this kind of developed spiral structure when the universe was still so young, well before the cosmos as a whole reached its peak rate of star formation.<br  /><br  />There is a small chance, however, that the galaxy's 10,000-light-year-long appendages may not be spiral arms in the traditional sense. Instead, they could be tidal tails, or streams of stars that were dislodged and flung outward during a gravitational interaction with a passing galaxy. But, the authors of the new study say, tidal tails are typically larger and less tightly wound around a galaxy's rotating disk than the arms of BRI 1335-0417 are observed to be."

      "summary": "Varied worlds large and small offer backyard observers spectacular targets for the naked eye, binoculars, and telescope.",
      "content": "Follow the night sky throughout the course of a year, and you'll start to pick out some patterns. The stars all seem to march in lock step across the sky. They rise in the east and set in the west, moving with a little more alacrity than the Sun. As a consequence, if you observe at the same time each night, the stars seem to slide slowly westward. That's why the summer sky appears so different from the winter sky. During the course of one full year, the stars make a complete circuit.<br /><br />Yet a few bright points of light break those rules. Even early civilizations recognized that a handful of celestial objects don't follow the same pattern but instead move relative to the stars. The ancients called these wandering objects \"planets\" and, along with the Sun and Moon, regarded them with special significance.<br /><br />Early civilizations recognized only five planets — Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn — the ones bright enough to show up easily to the naked eye. Astronomers using telescopes discovered three more during the past 225 years: Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Together, the planets make up the vast bulk of the material in the solar system outside the Sun.<br /><br />The eight planets besides Earth fall into two observational classes. The inferior planets — Mercury and Venus — lie between the Sun and Earth, and the superior planets (the other six) lie beyond Earth's orbit. The two categories show very different observational properties.<br /><br />Because inferior planets orbit closer to the Sun than Earth, they never stray far from their parent star. Innermost Mercury never appears farther than 28° from the Sun in our sky. This means it stays almost perpetually in twilight, glowing either in the west shortly after sunset or in the east shortly before sunrise. Despite shining brighter than all but the most prominent stars, Mercury remains an elusive object.<br /><br />With a bigger orbit than Mercury, Venus can appear up to 47° from the Sun. Although it often lies in twilight, Venus occasionally climbs into a completely dark sky. But you don't need that help to spot it — Venus is by far the brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. It shows up easily except during the fairly brief periods when it passes behind or in front of the Sun.<br /><br />An inferior planet appears most conspicuous around the time of its greatest elongation from the Sun. If you envision an inferior planet's orbit relative to Earth's, the moment when it passes directly between Earth and the Sun is called inferior conjunction. Because an inferior planet moves faster than Earth, it quickly pulls ahead of the Sun in our sky and eventually becomes visible in the east before dawn. It stands highest in the morning sky around the time it reaches greatest western elongation, then it sinks back toward the Sun. The planet then passes on the far side of the Sun from Earth, a configuration known as superior conjunction, before climbing into the western evening sky. It appears highest around greatest eastern elongation and then heads back toward the Sun for its next inferior conjunction. It takes Mercury an average of about 116 days to complete one cycle; Venus requires 584 days.<br /><br />Observers who own telescopes have to be content with tracking Mercury's and Venus's changing sizes and phases. Because Mercury presents such a small disk and turbulence near Earth's horizon distorts our view, there's really no hope of discerning any surface feature. And thick, highly reflective clouds permanently shroud the surface of Venus. Neither inferior planet varies much during the relatively long period it spends near superior conjunction. It lies farther from Earth then and so appears smaller, and its gibbous phase changes slowly. At greatest eastern elongation, the planet appears half-lit. The pace of change quickens between this elongation and inferior conjunction. The planet's size grows rapidly and the phase dwindles precipitously. For Venus, the apparent size grows from roughly 10\" across near superior conjunction to 60\" across at inferior conjunction. The size and phase changes play out in reverse as the planet moves from inferior to superior conjunction."

      "content": "March 19, 2007<br />The first step in forming a star is to get an interstellar cloud of gas and dust to collapse on itself. Astronomers have deduced several ways this could happen: a supernova shock wave, stellar winds or energetic radiation from massive stars, or a spiral arm density wave, to name a few.<br /><br />For our solar system, a supernova seems, at the very least, to have been involved. The oldest solid objects in the solar system — inclusions found in some meteorites — contained several short-lived radioactive nuclei, including aluminum-26, calcium-41, and iron-60. All of these have half-lives of at most a few million years, and so must have been injected into the developing solar system at its beginning.<br /><br />A team of planetary scientists led by Junya Miki from the University of Tokyo proposes the molecular cloud that gave birth to the Sun existed near a star containing more than 20 times the Sun's mass. This heavyweight star then underwent a \"mixing-fallback\" supernova, in which the exploding star's inner regions mixed. Some of this material got ejected, while the rest fell back on the collapsing core. Miki presented the team's findings this week at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston.<br /><br />The researchers looked at two possible scenarios. In the first, the supernova's shock wave would've compressed the molecular cloud, initiating the cloud's collapse. The supernova's ejecta, which contained the short-lived nuclei, was incorporated into the protostellar nebula. In the second, intense ultraviolet radiation from the massive star (and possible companions) would've already caused the cloud to collapse. The supernova then injected the radioactive elements into the protoplanetary disk.<br /><br />In the first case, the exploding star had to be between 6 and 16 light-years away. Only at that range would the shock wave have been strong enough to compress the molecular cloud but not so strong as to shred it. The meteorite inclusions would have formed within about 1 million years after the molecular cloud's collapse.<br /><br />In the second case, the exploding star would be only 1 to 2.5 light-years away. (The smaller distance results from the protoplanetary disk being much smaller than the molecular cloud in the other case, so the supernova had to be closer to deliver an equal dose of radioactive elements.) Under these conditions, the meteorite inclusions likely formed a few million years after the disk.<br /><br />The scientists admit it's hard to decide which case is more plausible. However, Miki confesses he leans toward the more distant bang that would've both triggered the molecular cloud's collapse and injected the radioactive elements."

      "summary": "Analysis of the comet samples the Stardust mission returned shows superheated rock, not icy dirt.",
      "content": "December 15, 2006<br />In January 2006, NASA's Stardust spacecraft landed smack in the middle of a Utah mud flat, its heavily-protected container holding thousands of precious particles of Comet Wild 2. The particles were captured in a glassy product called aerogel as the spacecraft encountered the comet beyond the orbit of Mars in January 2004. Now, after 200 scientists have completed their preliminary investigation of the particles, the Stardust team has announced its first batch of findings, which include surprises that will upset the conventional understanding of the early solar system.<br /><br />Team members, including Don Brownlee of the University of Washington, Michael Zolensky of the Johnson Space Center, and Scott Sandford of the NASA-Ames Research Center, announced the findings on Thursday at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.<br /><br />They characterized the first results as no less than shocking. The astronomers expected to find mostly interstellar grains — tiny, crystalline and noncrystalline specks that stuck together to form the cometary material. They found interstellar grains, but found much larger particles that are made of complex minerals, many of which had been shocked and melted in the distant past, and stuck together like brecciated rocks.<br /><br />Comets are mostly icy dirtballs, and they are presumed to have formed out in the very coldest part of the solar system. If this is so, how could they contain rock that was obviously superheated? This major puzzle now looms over planetary scientists.<br /><br />Brownlee introduced some of the most curious specific rocks that stuck in Stardust's aerogel, one by one. A tiny clump nicknamed Ada is an igneous rock, a silicate containing iron and olivine that formed in a molten environment. Another, called Inti, has a calcium-aluminum inclusion (CAI) reminiscent of those found in primitive meteorites like Allende. How could a CAI, a molten clump of minerals that formed before the Sun, turn up in something that should have come together in an icy deep-freeze?<br /><br />Another micro-rock called Febo is an iron-magnesium silicate, and one named Sitara contains iron, nickel sulfides, enstatite, and calcium and sodium silicates — the mineral components of rocks. \"We're seeing real rocks in comets,\" says Brownlee, sharing his amazement with journalists and fellow scientists. \"Yes, comets are made largely of ice, but also from exotic, high-temperature minerals.\" This finding will force astronomers to rethink their ideas about the origins of comets, the origin of the solar system, and the way crystalline silicates form around stars.<br /><br />\"We are finding the hottest minerals in the coldest places,\" says Brownlee. \"The major question is, 'How did they get there?'\" A slew of ideas exists, from so-called X-winds (blasts of outward energy in the early solar system) to turbulent eddies to orbital instabilities to some unknown thing that astronomers can't yet imagine.<br /><br />\"The biggest early shock for us is that Wild 2 formed from a great range of materials,\" adds Zolensky. \"There is no evidence of liquid water with this comet, in stark contrast to the earlier results with Tempel 1.\" The mixed bag of components brings to Zolensky's mind the idea of comets acting as a giant vacuum cleaner, sweeping up all sorts of particles. \"Maybe comets are as different as individuals,\" he suggests.<br /><br />Many of the particles studied thus far contain organics, stresses Sandford. \"They represent a more diverse group of organic compounds than we have seen in extraterrestrial material before,\" he says. They are rich in oxygen and nitrogen, and some have a chemical heritage that predates the solar system.<br /><br />Studying the comet's organic molecules will shed more light on the possibility that comets salted early Earth with the organic matter needed to initiate life on Earth. \"If you need some pixie dust to get life going and it has all these magical organics,\" says Brownlee, \"it could be very significant. A lot of this stuff got flung all around the early solar system.\"<br /><br />Studies of the many thousands of Wild 2 particles will go on for years, and will undoubtedly revise models of solar system formation. That's a pretty big first shot out of the box for the Stardust mission."

      "content": "What would our solar system look like if visitors from other worlds took a series of pictures?<br /><br />NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft did just that by piecing together the first portrait of our solar system from the inside looking out. Composed of 34 images, the mosaic provides a complement to the solar system portrait, from the outside looking in, taken by Voyager 1 in 1990.<br /><br />\"Obtaining this portrait was a terrific feat by the MESSENGER team,\" said Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institution of Washington. \"This snapshot of our neighborhood also reminds us that Earth is a member of a planetary family that was formed by common processes 4.5 billion years ago. Our spacecraft is soon to orbit the innermost member of the family, one that holds many new answers to how earthlike planets are assembled and evolve.\"<br /><br />MESSENGER's Wide Angle Camera (WAC) captured the images November 3 and 16, 2010. In the mosaic, all the planets are visible except for Uranus and Neptune, which were too faint to detect. Earth's moon and Jupiter's Galilean satellites — Callisto, Ganymede, Europa, and Io — can be seen in the WAC image insets. The solar system's perch on a spiral arm of the Milky Way Galaxy also afforded a beautiful view of a portion of the galaxy in the bottom center.<br /><br />\"The curved shape of the mosaic is due to the inclination of MESSENGER's orbit from the ecliptic — the plane in which Earth and most planets orbit — which means that the cameras must point up to see some planets and down to see others,\" said Brett Denevi from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. \"The images are stretched to make it easier to detect the planets, though this stretch also highlights light scattered off of the planet limbs, and in some cases creates artifacts such as the non-spherical shape of some planets.\"<br /><br />Assembling this portrait was no easy feat. \"It's not easy to find a moment when many of the planets are within a single field of view from that perspective, and we have strong Sun-pointing constraints on our ability to image in some directions,” said Solomon.<br /><br />APL's Hong Kang, from MESSENGER’s guidance and control team, used the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Solar System Simulator to pinpoint the relative positions of MESSENGER and the planets to determine if it was possible to see the planets from MESSENGER at any given time.<br /><br />\"I used the celestial coordinates of the planets at the time I wanted to observe them to verify with simulations that MESSENGER could see each of the planets,\" Kang said. \"I also used a satellite tool kit to verify that we had the planets in the field of view of MESSENGER’s Mercury Dual Imaging System.\"<br /><br />The MESSENGER team then had to determine how long the exposures needed to be for each planet.<br /><br />\"From exposure times that worked for previous imaging of stars with visual magnitudes similar to those of the planets, we chose exposure times that would allow us to obtain the appropriate number of counts (i.e., amount of light) in each planet image,\" said Nori Laslo from APL.<br /><br />\"We decided to take images using both the Narrow Angle Camera and the Wide Angle Camera for each planet so that we would cover the sky surrounding the planets and also image the planets themselves at as high a resolution as possible,\" Laslo said. \"I took all of these parameters, along with a variety of related settings, and began building the command sequence with the library of MDIS commands that we have to configure and control the camera system.\"<br /><br />Robin Vaughan, who worked with Kang to coordinate the pointing and timing of the MDIS, also played a role in Voyager's portrait.<br /><br />\"I was working as an optical navigation analyst at JPL for the Voyager-Neptune encounter,\" said Vaughan. \"I had to plan and generate the pointing commands for pictures of Neptune and its satellites against background stars that we used to improve our estimate of the spacecraft's trajectory leading up to the Neptune encounter. Voyager's solar system portrait was done a few years after that flyby and was coordinated by the imaging team. Our optical navigation image planning software was used to double check the pointing commands they had designed and confirm what they expected to see in each image.\"<br /><br />Vaughan did the same thing for MESSENGER’s portrait, using Kang’s designs. \"I used the SPICE trajectory files for the spacecraft generated by MESSENGER's navigation team, as well as routines in the SPICE toolkit, to write a software program that would identify windows when each of the planets would be visible to MDIS given the constraints on pivot angle and Sun keep-in zone for spacecraft attitude,\" she said.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, the MESSENGER portrait was a little more complicated than what was done for Voyager because scientists had to stay within the Sun keep-in constraints. \"With Voyager so far out in the solar system, the Sun is much fainter, and there were no constraints on the overall spacecraft attitude as far as the Sun was concerned,\" Vaughan said. \"Being in the inner solar system, MESSENGER has to constantly keep the sunshade pointing toward the Sun, which limits the periods when the different planets can be viewed even with the extra degree of freedom that MDIS has with its pivot capability.\"<br /><br />\"Seeing our solar system as just these little specks of light, it reminds you of how lucky we are that we've had the chance, through so many missions, to get up close and explore the incredible diversity and geology that each planet and moon displays,\" Denevi said. \"Mercury has been just a dot on the horizon for most of history, and we get to fill in the details and know it as a real world. What an amazing opportunity!”"

      "content": "Transcript<br />Welcome to “Tour the solar system.” In this series, we give you an overview of the objects in our neighborhood. This video focuses on Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system.<br /><br />Jupiter is typically the fourth-brightest object in Earth’s sky, trailing only the Sun, the Moon, and Venus. It always shines brighter than the brightest star, Sirius, and at its most brilliant beats Sirius by a factor of four. That’s an impressive feat for an object that lies more than 5 times farther from the Sun than Earth does.<br /><br />It shines so brightly because it’s so big. Jupiter’s equator spans 88,846 miles (142,984 kilometers), more than 11 times Earth’s diameter. More than 1,000 Earths could fit inside this giant planet. And Jupiter contains 318 times Earth’s mass. In fact, it holds twice as much mass as all the other planets in the solar system combined. Despite its vast size, it spins rapidly, completing one rotation in just under 10 hours.<br /><br />Jupiter is not a rocky sphere like Earth and the other inner planets. Instead, it is a giant ball of gas composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. When you look at Jupiter, you see the upper layers of its massive atmosphere. The cloud tops get sheared into light and dark bands by alternating east and west winds, which blow at tornadic-like speeds of up to 330 mph (530 km/h).

They rise in the east and set in the west, moving with a little more alacrity than the Sun. As a consequence, if you observe at the same time each night, the stars seem to slide slowly westward. That's why the summer sky appears so different from the winter sky. During the course of one full year, the stars make a complete circuit.<br /><br />Yet a few bright points of light break those rules. Even early civilizations recognized that a handful of celestial objects don't follow the same pattern but instead move relative to the stars. The ancients called these wandering objects \"planets\" and, along with the Sun and Moon, regarded them with special significance.<br /><br />Early civilizations recognized only five planets — Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn — the ones bright enough to show up easily to the naked eye. Astronomers using telescopes discovered three more during the past 225 years: Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Together, the planets make up the vast bulk of the material in the solar system outside the Sun.<br /><br />The eight planets besides Earth fall into two observational classes. The inferior planets — Mercury and Venus — lie between the Sun and Earth, and the superior planets (the other six) lie beyond Earth's orbit. The two categories show very different observational properties.<br /><br />Because inferior planets orbit closer to the Sun than Earth, they never stray far from their parent star. Innermost Mercury never appears farther than 28° from the Sun in our sky. This means it stays almost perpetually in twilight, glowing either in the west shortly after sunset or in the east shortly before sunrise. Despite shining brighter than all but the most prominent stars, Mercury remains an elusive object.<br /><br />With a bigger orbit than Mercury, Venus can appear up to 47° from the Sun. Although it often lies in twilight, Venus occasionally climbs into a completely dark sky. But you don't need that help to spot it — Venus is by far the brightest object in the sky after the Sun and Moon. It shows up easily except during the fairly brief periods when it passes behind or in front of the Sun.<br /><br />An inferior planet appears most conspicuous around the time of its greatest elongation from the Sun. If you envision an inferior planet's orbit relative to Earth's, the moment when it passes directly between Earth and the Sun is called inferior conjunction. Because an inferior planet moves faster than Earth, it quickly pulls ahead of the Sun in our sky and eventually becomes visible in the east before dawn. It stands highest in the morning sky around the time it reaches greatest western elongation, then it sinks back toward the Sun. The planet then passes on the far side of the Sun from Earth, a configuration known as superior conjunction, before climbing into the western evening sky. It appears highest around greatest eastern elongation and then heads back toward the Sun for its next inferior conjunction. It takes Mercury an average of about 116 days to complete one cycle; Venus requires 584 days.<br /><br />Observers who own telescopes have to be content with tracking Mercury's and Venus's changing sizes and phases. Because Mercury presents such a small disk and turbulence near Earth's horizon distorts our view, there's really no hope of discerning any surface feature. And thick, highly reflective clouds permanently shroud the surface of Venus. Neither inferior planet varies much during the relatively long period it spends near superior conjunction. It lies farther from Earth then and so appears smaller, and its gibbous phase changes slowly. At greatest eastern elongation, the planet appears half-lit. The pace of change quickens between this elongation and inferior conjunction. The planet's size grows rapidly and the phase dwindles precipitously. For Venus, the apparent size grows from roughly 10\" across near superior conjunction to 60\" across at inferior conjunction. The size and phase changes play out in reverse as the planet moves from inferior to superior conjunction."

Astronomers have deduced several ways this could happen: a supernova shock wave, stellar winds or energetic radiation from massive stars, or a spiral arm density wave, to name a few.<br /><br />For our solar system, a supernova seems, at the very least, to have been involved. The oldest solid objects in the solar system — inclusions found in some meteorites — contained several short-lived radioactive nuclei, including aluminum-26, calcium-41, and iron-60. All of these have half-lives of at most a few million years, and so must have been injected into the developing solar system at its beginning.<br /><br />A team of planetary scientists led by Junya Miki from the University of Tokyo proposes the molecular cloud that gave birth to the Sun existed near a star containing more than 20 times the Sun's mass. This heavyweight star then underwent a \"mixing-fallback\" supernova, in which the exploding star's inner regions mixed. Some of this material got ejected, while the rest fell back on the collapsing core. Miki presented the team's findings this week at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston.<br /><br />The researchers looked at two possible scenarios. In the first, the supernova's shock wave would've compressed the molecular cloud, initiating the cloud's collapse. The supernova's ejecta, which contained the short-lived nuclei, was incorporated into the protostellar nebula. In the second, intense ultraviolet radiation from the massive star (and possible companions) would've already caused the cloud to collapse. The supernova then injected the radioactive elements into the protoplanetary disk.<br /><br />In the first case, the exploding star had to be between 6 and 16 light-years away. Only at that range would the shock wave have been strong enough to compress the molecular cloud but not so strong as to shred it. The meteorite inclusions would have formed within about 1 million years after the molecular cloud's collapse.<br /><br />In the second case, the exploding star would be only 1 to 2.5 light-years away. (The smaller distance results from the protoplanetary disk being much smaller than the molecular cloud in the other case, so the supernova had to be closer to deliver an equal dose of radioactive elements.) Under these conditions, the meteorite inclusions likely formed a few million years after the disk.<br /><br />The scientists admit it's hard to decide which case is more plausible. However, Miki confesses he leans toward the more distant bang that would've both triggered the molecular cloud's collapse and injected the radioactive elements."

The particles were captured in a glassy product called aerogel as the spacecraft encountered the comet beyond the orbit of Mars in January 2004. Now, after 200 scientists have completed their preliminary investigation of the particles, the Stardust team has announced its first batch of findings, which include surprises that will upset the conventional understanding of the early solar system.<br /><br />Team members, including Don Brownlee of the University of Washington, Michael Zolensky of the Johnson Space Center, and Scott Sandford of the NASA-Ames Research Center, announced the findings on Thursday at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.<br /><br />They characterized the first results as no less than shocking. The astronomers expected to find mostly interstellar grains — tiny, crystalline and noncrystalline specks that stuck together to form the cometary material. They found interstellar grains, but found much larger particles that are made of complex minerals, many of which had been shocked and melted in the distant past, and stuck together like brecciated rocks.<br /><br />Comets are mostly icy dirtballs, and they are presumed to have formed out in the very coldest part of the solar system. If this is so, how could they contain rock that was obviously superheated? This major puzzle now looms over planetary scientists.<br /><br />Brownlee introduced some of the most curious specific rocks that stuck in Stardust's aerogel, one by one. A tiny clump nicknamed Ada is an igneous rock, a silicate containing iron and olivine that formed in a molten environment. Another, called Inti, has a calcium-aluminum inclusion (CAI) reminiscent of those found in primitive meteorites like Allende. How could a CAI, a molten clump of minerals that formed before the Sun, turn up in something that should have come together in an icy deep-freeze?<br /><br />Another micro-rock called Febo is an iron-magnesium silicate, and one named Sitara contains iron, nickel sulfides, enstatite, and calcium and sodium silicates — the mineral components of rocks. \"We're seeing real rocks in comets,\" says Brownlee, sharing his amazement with journalists and fellow scientists. \"Yes, comets are made largely of ice, but also from exotic, high-temperature minerals.\" This finding will force astronomers to rethink their ideas about the origins of comets, the origin of the solar system, and the way crystalline silicates form around stars.<br /><br />\"We are finding the hottest minerals in the coldest places,\" says Brownlee. \"The major question is, 'How did they get there?'\" A slew of ideas exists, from so-called X-winds (blasts of outward energy in the early solar system) to turbulent eddies to orbital instabilities to some unknown thing that astronomers can't yet imagine.<br /><br />\"The biggest early shock for us is that Wild 2 formed from a great range of materials,\" adds Zolensky. \"There is no evidence of liquid water with this comet, in stark contrast to the earlier results with Tempel 1.\" The mixed bag of components brings to Zolensky's mind the idea of comets acting as a giant vacuum cleaner, sweeping up all sorts of particles. \"Maybe comets are as different as individuals,\" he suggests.<br /><br />Many of the particles studied thus far contain organics, stresses Sandford. \"They represent a more diverse group of organic compounds than we have seen in extraterrestrial material before,\" he says. They are rich in oxygen and nitrogen, and some have a chemical heritage that predates the solar system.<br /><br />Studying the comet's organic molecules will shed more light on the possibility that comets salted early Earth with the organic matter needed to initiate life on Earth. \"If you need some pixie dust to get life going and it has all these magical organics,\" says Brownlee, \"it could be very significant. A lot of this stuff got flung all around the early solar system.\"<br /><br />Studies of the many thousands of Wild 2 particles will go on for years, and will undoubtedly revise models of solar system formation. That's a pretty big first shot out of the box for the Stardust mission."

      "content": "What would our solar system look like if visitors from other worlds took a series of pictures?<br /><br />NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft did just that by piecing together the first portrait of our solar system from the inside looking out. Composed of 34 images, the mosaic provides a complement to the solar system portrait, from the outside looking in, taken by Voyager 1 in 1990.<br /><br />\"Obtaining this portrait was a terrific feat by the MESSENGER team,\" said Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institution of Washington. \"This snapshot of our neighborhood also reminds us that Earth is a member of a planetary family that was formed by common processes 4.5 billion years ago. Our spacecraft is soon to orbit the innermost member of the family, one that holds many new answers to how earthlike planets are assembled and evolve.\"<br /><br />MESSENGER's Wide Angle Camera (WAC) captured the images November 3 and 16, 2010. In the mosaic, all the planets are visible except for Uranus and Neptune, which were too faint to detect. Earth's moon and Jupiter's Galilean satellites — Callisto, Ganymede, Europa, and Io — can be seen in the WAC image insets. The solar system's perch on a spiral arm of the Milky Way Galaxy also afforded a beautiful view of a portion of the galaxy in the bottom center.<br /><br />\"The curved shape of the mosaic is due to the inclination of MESSENGER's orbit from the ecliptic — the plane in which Earth and most planets orbit — which means that the cameras must point up to see some planets and down to see others,\" said Brett Denevi from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. \"The images are stretched to make it easier to detect the planets, though this stretch also highlights light scattered off of the planet limbs, and in some cases creates artifacts such as the non-spherical shape of some planets.\"<br /><br />Assembling this portrait was no easy feat. \"It's not easy to find a moment when many of the planets are within a single field of view from that perspective, and we have strong Sun-pointing constraints on our ability to image in some directions,” said Solomon.<br /><br />APL's Hong Kang, from MESSENGER’s guidance and control team, used the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Solar System Simulator to pinpoint the relative positions of MESSENGER and the planets to determine if it was possible to see the planets from MESSENGER at any given time.<br /><br />\"I used the celestial coordinates of the planets at the time I wanted to observe them to verify with simulations that MESSENGER could see each of the planets,\" Kang said. \"I also used a satellite tool kit to verify that we had the planets in the field of view of MESSENGER’s Mercury Dual Imaging System.\"<br /><br />The MESSENGER team then had to determine how long the exposures needed to be for each planet.<br /><br />\"From exposure times that worked for previous imaging of stars with visual magnitudes similar to those of the planets, we chose exposure times that would allow us to obtain the appropriate number of counts (i.e., amount of light) in each planet image,\" said Nori Laslo from APL.<br /><br />\"We decided to take images using both the Narrow Angle Camera and the Wide Angle Camera for each planet so that we would cover the sky surrounding the planets and also image the planets themselves at as high a resolution as possible,\" Laslo said. \"I took all of these parameters, along with a variety of related settings, and began building the command sequence with the library of MDIS commands that we have to configure and control the camera system.\"<br /><br />Robin Vaughan, who worked with Kang to coordinate the pointing and timing of the MDIS, also played a role in Voyager's portrait.<br /><br />\"I was working as an optical navigation analyst at JPL for the Voyager-Neptune encounter,\" said Vaughan. \"I had to plan and generate the pointing commands for pictures of Neptune and its satellites against background stars that we used to improve our estimate of the spacecraft's trajectory leading up to the Neptune encounter. Voyager's solar system portrait was done a few years after that flyby and was coordinated by the imaging team. Our optical navigation image planning software was used to double check the pointing commands they had designed and confirm what they expected to see in each image.\"<br /><br />Vaughan did the same thing for MESSENGER’s portrait, using Kang’s designs. \"I used the SPICE trajectory files for the spacecraft generated by MESSENGER's navigation team, as well as routines in the SPICE toolkit, to write a software program that would identify windows when each of the planets would be visible to MDIS given the constraints on pivot angle and Sun keep-in zone for spacecraft attitude,\" she said.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, the MESSENGER portrait was a little more complicated than what was done for Voyager because scientists had to stay within the Sun keep-in constraints. \"With Voyager so far out in the solar system, the Sun is much fainter, and there were no constraints on the overall spacecraft attitude as far as the Sun was concerned,\" Vaughan said. \"Being in the inner solar system, MESSENGER has to constantly keep the sunshade pointing toward the Sun, which limits the periods when the different planets can be viewed even with the extra degree of freedom that MDIS has with its pivot capability.\"<br /><br />\"Seeing our solar system as just these little specks of light, it reminds you of how lucky we are that we've had the chance, through so many missions, to get up close and explore the incredible diversity and geology that each planet and moon displays,\" Denevi said. \"Mercury has been just a dot on the horizon for most of history, and we get to fill in the details and know it as a real world. What an amazing opportunity!”"

      "content": "Transcript<br />Welcome to “Tour the solar system.” In this series, we give you an overview of the objects in our neighborhood. This video focuses on Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system.<br /><br />Jupiter is typically the fourth-brightest object in Earth’s sky, trailing only the Sun, the Moon, and Venus. It always shines brighter than the brightest star, Sirius, and at its most brilliant beats Sirius by a factor of four. That’s an impressive feat for an object that lies more than 5 times farther from the Sun than Earth does.<br /><br />It shines so brightly because it’s so big. Jupiter’s equator spans 88,846 miles (142,984 kilometers), more than 11 times Earth’s diameter. More than 1,000 Earths could fit inside this giant planet. And Jupiter contains 318 times Earth’s mass. In fact, it holds twice as much mass as all the other planets in the solar system combined. Despite its vast size, it spins rapidly, completing one rotation in just under 10 hours.<br /><br />Jupiter is not a rocky sphere like Earth and the other inner planets. Instead, it is a giant ball of gas composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. When you look at Jupiter, you see the upper layers of its massive atmosphere. The cloud tops get sheared into light and dark bands by alternating east and west winds, which blow at tornadic-like speeds of up to 330 mph (530 km/h). High-altitude clouds made mostly of ammonia cover the dark bands, which astronomers call belts. The brighter bands, called zones, are relatively cloud-free.<br /><br />Giant storms break up the belts and zones. The most famous of these is the Great Red Spot, a high-pressure system that observers first saw more than 300 years ago. This huge storm is more than twice the size of Earth.

How could a CAI, a molten clump of minerals that formed before the Sun, turn up in something that should have come together in an icy deep-freeze?<br /><br />Another micro-rock called Febo is an iron-magnesium silicate, and one named Sitara contains iron, nickel sulfides, enstatite, and calcium and sodium silicates — the mineral components of rocks. \"We're seeing real rocks in comets,\" says Brownlee, sharing his amazement with journalists and fellow scientists. \"Yes, comets are made largely of ice, but also from exotic, high-temperature minerals.\" This finding will force astronomers to rethink their ideas about the origins of comets, the origin of the solar system, and the way crystalline silicates form around stars.<br /><br />\"We are finding the hottest minerals in the coldest places,\" says Brownlee. \"The major question is, 'How did they get there?'\" A slew of ideas exists, from so-called X-winds (blasts of outward energy in the early solar system) to turbulent eddies to orbital instabilities to some unknown thing that astronomers can't yet imagine.<br /><br />\"The biggest early shock for us is that Wild 2 formed from a great range of materials,\" adds Zolensky. \"There is no evidence of liquid water with this comet, in stark contrast to the earlier results with Tempel 1.\" The mixed bag of components brings to Zolensky's mind the idea of comets acting as a giant vacuum cleaner, sweeping up all sorts of particles. \"Maybe comets are as different as individuals,\" he suggests.<br /><br />Many of the particles studied thus far contain organics, stresses Sandford. \"They represent a more diverse group of organic compounds than we have seen in extraterrestrial material before,\" he says. They are rich in oxygen and nitrogen, and some have a chemical heritage that predates the solar system.<br /><br />Studying the comet's organic molecules will shed more light on the possibility that comets salted early Earth with the organic matter needed to initiate life on Earth. \"If you need some pixie dust to get life going and it has all these magical organics,\" says Brownlee, \"it could be very significant. A lot of this stuff got flung all around the early solar system.\"<br /><br />Studies of the many thousands of Wild 2 particles will go on for years, and will undoubtedly revise models of solar system formation. That's a pretty big first shot out of the box for the Stardust mission."

      "content": "What would our solar system look like if visitors from other worlds took a series of pictures?<br /><br />NASA's MESSENGER spacecraft did just that by piecing together the first portrait of our solar system from the inside looking out. Composed of 34 images, the mosaic provides a complement to the solar system portrait, from the outside looking in, taken by Voyager 1 in 1990.<br /><br />\"Obtaining this portrait was a terrific feat by the MESSENGER team,\" said Sean Solomon from the Carnegie Institution of Washington. \"This snapshot of our neighborhood also reminds us that Earth is a member of a planetary family that was formed by common processes 4.5 billion years ago. Our spacecraft is soon to orbit the innermost member of the family, one that holds many new answers to how earthlike planets are assembled and evolve.\"<br /><br />MESSENGER's Wide Angle Camera (WAC) captured the images November 3 and 16, 2010. In the mosaic, all the planets are visible except for Uranus and Neptune, which were too faint to detect. Earth's moon and Jupiter's Galilean satellites — Callisto, Ganymede, Europa, and Io — can be seen in the WAC image insets. The solar system's perch on a spiral arm of the Milky Way Galaxy also afforded a beautiful view of a portion of the galaxy in the bottom center.<br /><br />\"The curved shape of the mosaic is due to the inclination of MESSENGER's orbit from the ecliptic — the plane in which Earth and most planets orbit — which means that the cameras must point up to see some planets and down to see others,\" said Brett Denevi from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland. \"The images are stretched to make it easier to detect the planets, though this stretch also highlights light scattered off of the planet limbs, and in some cases creates artifacts such as the non-spherical shape of some planets.\"<br /><br />Assembling this portrait was no easy feat. \"It's not easy to find a moment when many of the planets are within a single field of view from that perspective, and we have strong Sun-pointing constraints on our ability to image in some directions,” said Solomon.<br /><br />APL's Hong Kang, from MESSENGER’s guidance and control team, used the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Solar System Simulator to pinpoint the relative positions of MESSENGER and the planets to determine if it was possible to see the planets from MESSENGER at any given time.<br /><br />\"I used the celestial coordinates of the planets at the time I wanted to observe them to verify with simulations that MESSENGER could see each of the planets,\" Kang said. \"I also used a satellite tool kit to verify that we had the planets in the field of view of MESSENGER’s Mercury Dual Imaging System.\"<br /><br />The MESSENGER team then had to determine how long the exposures needed to be for each planet.<br /><br />\"From exposure times that worked for previous imaging of stars with visual magnitudes similar to those of the planets, we chose exposure times that would allow us to obtain the appropriate number of counts (i.e., amount of light) in each planet image,\" said Nori Laslo from APL.<br /><br />\"We decided to take images using both the Narrow Angle Camera and the Wide Angle Camera for each planet so that we would cover the sky surrounding the planets and also image the planets themselves at as high a resolution as possible,\" Laslo said. \"I took all of these parameters, along with a variety of related settings, and began building the command sequence with the library of MDIS commands that we have to configure and control the camera system.\"<br /><br />Robin Vaughan, who worked with Kang to coordinate the pointing and timing of the MDIS, also played a role in Voyager's portrait.<br /><br />\"I was working as an optical navigation analyst at JPL for the Voyager-Neptune encounter,\" said Vaughan. \"I had to plan and generate the pointing commands for pictures of Neptune and its satellites against background stars that we used to improve our estimate of the spacecraft's trajectory leading up to the Neptune encounter. Voyager's solar system portrait was done a few years after that flyby and was coordinated by the imaging team. Our optical navigation image planning software was used to double check the pointing commands they had designed and confirm what they expected to see in each image.\"<br /><br />Vaughan did the same thing for MESSENGER’s portrait, using Kang’s designs. \"I used the SPICE trajectory files for the spacecraft generated by MESSENGER's navigation team, as well as routines in the SPICE toolkit, to write a software program that would identify windows when each of the planets would be visible to MDIS given the constraints on pivot angle and Sun keep-in zone for spacecraft attitude,\" she said.<br /><br />From a technical standpoint, the MESSENGER portrait was a little more complicated than what was done for Voyager because scientists had to stay within the Sun keep-in constraints. \"With Voyager so far out in the solar system, the Sun is much fainter, and there were no constraints on the overall spacecraft attitude as far as the Sun was concerned,\" Vaughan said. \"Being in the inner solar system, MESSENGER has to constantly keep the sunshade pointing toward the Sun, which limits the periods when the different planets can be viewed even with the extra degree of freedom that MDIS has with its pivot capability.\"<br /><br />\"Seeing our solar system as just these little specks of light, it reminds you of how lucky we are that we've had the chance, through so many missions, to get up close and explore the incredible diversity and geology that each planet and moon displays,\" Denevi said. \"Mercury has been just a dot on the horizon for most of history, and we get to fill in the details and know it as a real world. What an amazing opportunity!”"

      "content": "Transcript<br />Welcome to “Tour the solar system.” In this series, we give you an overview of the objects in our neighborhood. This video focuses on Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system.<br /><br />Jupiter is typically the fourth-brightest object in Earth’s sky, trailing only the Sun, the Moon, and Venus. It always shines brighter than the brightest star, Sirius, and at its most brilliant beats Sirius by a factor of four. That’s an impressive feat for an object that lies more than 5 times farther from the Sun than Earth does.<br /><br />It shines so brightly because it’s so big. Jupiter’s equator spans 88,846 miles (142,984 kilometers), more than 11 times Earth’s diameter. More than 1,000 Earths could fit inside this giant planet. And Jupiter contains 318 times Earth’s mass. In fact, it holds twice as much mass as all the other planets in the solar system combined. Despite its vast size, it spins rapidly, completing one rotation in just under 10 hours.<br /><br />Jupiter is not a rocky sphere like Earth and the other inner planets. Instead, it is a giant ball of gas composed mostly of hydrogen and helium. When you look at Jupiter, you see the upper layers of its massive atmosphere. The cloud tops get sheared into light and dark bands by alternating east and west winds, which blow at tornadic-like speeds of up to 330 mph (530 km/h). High-altitude clouds made mostly of ammonia cover the dark bands, which astronomers call belts. The brighter bands, called zones, are relatively cloud-free.<br /><br />Giant storms break up the belts and zones. The most famous of these is the Great Red Spot, a high-pressure system that observers first saw more than 300 years ago. This huge storm is more than twice the size of Earth. Its color, which can vary from salmon-pink to brick-red, most likely arises from sulfur compounds dredged up from below by the storm’s intense winds."

      "summary": "After questioning human space flight for 44 years, the United Kingdom's Royal Astronomical Society has changed its stance.",
      "content": "October 25, 2005<br />On October 18, the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) of the United Kingdom (UK) changed its position and now supports human space exploration. While astronauts from Russia, the United States, and China have collectively orbited Earth, walked upon the Moon, lived on the Mir Space Station and the International Space Station (ISS) during the past 44 years, the UK previously questioned the prudence of sending humans into space and to explore other planets. Although a member of the European Space Agency (ESA), the UK had funded only robotic space missions.<br /><br />Some of the reasons for the RAS' opposition were that humans need a bevy of support to go into space: air; water and food; a disposal method or storage space for waste materials; protection from extreme temperature and harmful radiation. Other considerations include the physical consequences of living and working in cramped quarters without gravity, and the mental toll of living in near isolation.<br /><br />Escaping Earth's gravity and re-entering its atmosphere are even more perilous undertakings than surviving the relative cold and calm of outer space. Technical failures and human errors have resulted in the deaths of both Russian cosmonauts and U.S. astronauts.<br /><br />For example, in 1967, a solar panel on the USSR's Soyuz 1 did not deploy and, ultimately, resulted in the death of cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov upon the craft's re-entry. In 2003, all seven astronauts aboard the space shuttle Columbia died when the shuttle disintegrated over Texas. A carbon panel damaged during takeoff was mistakenly believed to pose no serious threat to the craft and its occupants.<br /><br />It is also expensive to launch humans and their support materials into space. Many UK scientists believe human space exploration diverts resources from robotic missions. Robots require less space, no food, no air, and can be replaced, whereas people cannot.<br /><br />So what caused the RAS to change its stance? It comes down to adaptability, dexterity, and public support. After appointing an independent commission to re-examine \"The Scientific Case for Human Space Flight\" in December 2004, the RAS was advised that \"profound scientific questions relating to the history of the solar system and the existence of life beyond Earth can best — perhaps only — be achieved by human exploration on the Moon or Mars, supported by appropriate automated systems.\" Robots don't yet possess the adaptability or dexterity required for some missions, like the repair mission for the Hubble Space Telescope.<br /><br />The RAS commission also found that \"the capabilities of robotic spacecraft will fall well short of those of human explorers\" when it comes to in-depth exploration of the Moon and Mars. Additionally, a BBC opinion poll indicates public support is strong for the UK's involvement in human space flight.<br /><br />President Bush's January announcement of a renewed U.S. commitment to return to the Moon and Mars with crewed missions, and China's 2003 launch of an astronaut into Earth orbit, suggest human space flight is here to stay. And with the RAS's support, it may gain more ground; future space flights may need to accommodate both humans and robots."

The field of interstellar spacecraft research has been a fringe field for many decades, with various groups conducting one-off studies with no vision for a sustainable multidisciplinary and multidecadal research plan. We live at a time where imagination impinges on reality and the Internet makes educational resources ubiquitous. We have seen the incredible power of crowd-contributed content in Wikipedia, effectively the world’s first and most successful crowd-research portal.<br /><br />“The reason why Icarus has been successful in implementing organized interstellar research plans is because we have been successful in assembling a team of hundreds of incredibly willing and capable people out there starving to learn more about space exploration, and who are willing to contribute hundreds of hours of volunteer work per month. Icarus currently has 48 designers and consultants from all over the world who have contributed approximately 10,000 man-hours of research to date, and have attended nine international conferences representing Icarus with 16 peer-reviewed publications and 89 internal phase studies building up to designing the spacecraft. I would make a personal note that Icarus has profoundly capable program managers leading each of our research efforts and a robust administrative structure, currently led by President Richard Obousy. Icarus Interstellar has achieved all this with no formal funding source.<br /><br />“Project Icarus is currently in phase four of 10, while we have launched 10 other projects, including an experimental research group. We also have our Icarus students, Tiffany Frierson (U.S.), Divya Shankar (India), and Christopher Pickard (Canada) conducting a supervised design project, re-examining the Project Longshot spacecraft study, conducted in 1987 by U.S. Naval Academy aerospace engineering students. Anyone willing to participate, with a good head on their shoulders and a passion for space exploration can participate in our studies.”<br /><br />Anyone interested in joining the effort, or curious for even more information, can visit www.icarusinterstellar.org. As Tziolas points out, scientific progress is littered with breakthroughs that might once have seemed equally outlandish.<br /><br />“In 1901, H. G. Wells published The First Men in the Moon. Neil Armstrong walked on the lunar surface in 1969, only 68 years later.<br /><br />“In 1897, J. J. Thomson discovered the electron. The first ground experimental nuclear rocket engine (XE) was tested in Jackass Flats, Nevada, only 70 years later.<br /><br />“In 1946, the world’s first computer, ENIAC came online. In 2011, the iPhone 4S delivers unprecedented mobile computing power to the palm of our hands, only 65 years later.<br /><br />“In 2011, Icarus Interstellar was formed. Our mission is to achieve interstellar flight by 2100.”"

The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV) flew a flawless reentry and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean just west of the Galapagos islands.<br /><br />The IXV spaceplane lifted off at 13:40 GMT (14:40 CET) on February 11 from Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, atop a Vega rocket. It separated from Vega at an altitude of 211 miles (340 kilometers) and continued up to 256 miles (412km). Re-entering from this suborbital path, it recorded a vast amount of data from more than 300 advanced and conventional sensors.<br /><br />As it descended, the 16.4-foot-long (5 meters), 2-ton craft maneuvered to decelerate from hypersonic to supersonic speed. The entry speed of 4.7 miles per second (7.5 km/s) at an altitude of 75 miles (120km) created the same conditions as those for a vehicle returning from low-Earth orbit.<br /><br />IXV glided through the atmosphere before parachutes deployed to slow the descent further for a safe splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />The Mission Control Center at the ALTEC Advanced Logistics Technology Engineering Center in Turin, Italy, closely monitored IXV during the mission, receiving flight and instrument data from the entire ground network, including the fixed ground stations in Libreville, Gabon, and Malindi, Kenya, and the station on the Nos Aries recovery ship in the Pacific.<br /><br />Balloons are now keeping IXV afloat while the recovery vessel hurries to pick it up. It will be returned to Europe for detailed analysis in ESA’s technical center, ESTEC, in the Netherlands.<br /><br />Mastering reentry will open a new chapter for ESA. Such a capability is a cornerstone for reusable launcher stages, sample return from other planets and crew return from space, as well as for future Earth observation, microgravity research, satellite servicing, and disposal missions.<br /><br />The initial results from the flight are expected to be released in around six weeks.<br /><br />The results will feed the Program for Reusable In-Orbit Demonstrator for Europe (Pride), which is being studied under funding decided at ESA’s last two Ministerial Councils. The reusable Pride spaceplane would be launched on Europe’s Vega light rocket, orbit, and land automatically on a runway.<br /><br />“IXV has opened a new chapter for ESA in terms of reentry capabilities and reusability,” said Jean-Jacques Dordain from ESA. “ESA and its member states, together with European space industry, are now ready to take up new challenges in several fields of space transportation, in future launchers, robotic exploration, or human spaceflight.”<br /><br />“This mission will teach us a lot about the technologies we need to apply in new launch systems, in particular when we think about reusable systems,” said Gaele Winters from ESA.<br /><br />“This was a short mission with big impact,” noted Giorgio Tumino from ESA. “The cutting-edge technology we validated today and the data gathered from the sensors aboard IXV will open numerous opportunities for Europe to develop ambitious plans in space transportation for a multitude of applications.”"

      "content": "August 25, 2005<br />NASAhas announced that the space shuttle likely won't fly before March 2006. Part of the delay is caused by the return of external tanks to the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, the space agency said.<br /><br />Insulating foam broke off of Discovery's external tank moments after STS-114 launched July 26, surprising astronauts and shuttle managers who thought the problem was fixed.<br /><br />Factory seconds<br />The first tank to be returned, ET-119, set sail on a covered barge Tuesday and should arrive at Michoud over the weekend. According to Wayne Hale, deputy manager of the shuttle program, the tank is expected to be back at the Kennedy Space Center's (KSC) Florida docks by mid-November. NASA plans to return two other external tanks — ET-120 and ET-118 — already on hand. Hale said the last of these would be shipped back to KSC in mid-January 2006.<br /><br />At an August 18 press conference, NASA's Bill Gerstenmaier said an area of interest on the tanks is the PAL (Protuberance Air Load) ramp, a hand-applied foam ridge that protects cables and pressurized lines during launch. The PAL ramp on STS-114's external tank shed the largest piece of foam. In 2003, falling foam caused damage that ultimately doomed space shuttle Columbia and its crew.<br /><br />\"We want to take a look at some of the tanks that are already set up, ready to go fly. So, we want to dissect some of the PAL ramps that are on vehicles,\" he said. \"I'm not picking March because we've made progress, but we're starting to understand … the areas that we want to do rework on. … We're going to have to repair the PAL ramp, we think,\" Gerstenmaier admitted. \"How exactly we do that, we don't know yet.\"<br /><br />\"We don't see that the task remaining before us is as difficult as the tasks we have behind us,\" said NASA Administrator Mike Griffin.<br /><br />Minority report<br />The Return to Flight Task Group published its final report August 17, the day before the press conference. Headed by former astronauts Thomas Stafford and Richard Covey, the group oversaw NASA's efforts to implement safety reforms recommended by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board.<br /><br />What made headlines was a minority opinion drafted by seven of the panel's 26 members blasting NASA management. The group pointed out that NASA scheduled and then delayed Discovery's return to space 15 times, and this schedule pressure affected what fixes would be considered. With a launch only a few months away, NASA managers shied away from long-term, and possibly superior, changes to the shuttle.<br /><br />Shuttle managers did not \"accurately evaluate how much or how little risk is associated with their decisions, particularly decisions to sidestep or abbreviate any given procedure or process,\" the report said.<br /><br />Management relied on past success as evidence of safety, a fault that played a role in both the Columbia and the 1986 Challenger disasters. \"It has proven irresistible for some officials to characterize the modified external tank as 'safer' … or even 'fixed,' when neither the baseline of the old tanks nor the quantitative improvement of the new design has been established,\" the report said. \"The tank may well be safer but without … objective evidence it is impossible to know.\"<br /><br />One result of these problems was skyrocketing costs. \"At the end of 2 ½ years and $1.5 billion or more, it is not clear what has been accomplished,\" the critique said.<br /><br />Neither Stafford, Covey, nor NASA management would comment on the minority view other than to say it represents the personal opinion of certain task-group members. Covey noted he thinks NASA managers are \"approaching risk and the acceptance of risk\" appropriately. \"We have to go fly to learn a lot of the things we learned on this flight,\" he said."

      "content": "October 25, 2005<br />On October 18, the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS) of the United Kingdom (UK) changed its position and now supports human space exploration. While astronauts from Russia, the United States, and China have collectively orbited Earth, walked upon the Moon, lived on the Mir Space Station and the International Space Station (ISS) during the past 44 years, the UK previously questioned the prudence of sending humans into space and to explore other planets. Although a member of the European Space Agency (ESA), the UK had funded only robotic space missions.<br /><br />Some of the reasons for the RAS' opposition were that humans need a bevy of support to go into space: air; water and food; a disposal method or storage space for waste materials; protection from extreme temperature and harmful radiation. Other considerations include the physical consequences of living and working in cramped quarters without gravity, and the mental toll of living in near isolation.<br /><br />Escaping Earth's gravity and re-entering its atmosphere are even more perilous undertakings than surviving the relative cold and calm of outer space. Technical failures and human errors have resulted in the deaths of both Russian cosmonauts and U.S. astronauts.<br /><br />For example, in 1967, a solar panel on the USSR's Soyuz 1 did not deploy and, ultimately, resulted in the death of cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov upon the craft's re-entry. In 2003, all seven astronauts aboard the space shuttle Columbia died when the shuttle disintegrated over Texas. A carbon panel damaged during takeoff was mistakenly believed to pose no serious threat to the craft and its occupants.<br /><br />It is also expensive to launch humans and their support materials into space. Many UK scientists believe human space exploration diverts resources from robotic missions. Robots require less space, no food, no air, and can be replaced, whereas people cannot.<br /><br />So what caused the RAS to change its stance? It comes down to adaptability, dexterity, and public support. After appointing an independent commission to re-examine \"The Scientific Case for Human Space Flight\" in December 2004, the RAS was advised that \"profound scientific questions relating to the history of the solar system and the existence of life beyond Earth can best — perhaps only — be achieved by human exploration on the Moon or Mars, supported by appropriate automated systems.\" Robots don't yet possess the adaptability or dexterity required for some missions, like the repair mission for the Hubble Space Telescope.<br /><br />The RAS commission also found that \"the capabilities of robotic spacecraft will fall well short of those of human explorers\" when it comes to in-depth exploration of the Moon and Mars. Additionally, a BBC opinion poll indicates public support is strong for the UK's involvement in human space flight.<br /><br />President Bush's January announcement of a renewed U.S. commitment to return to the Moon and Mars with crewed missions, and China's 2003 launch of an astronaut into Earth orbit, suggest human space flight is here to stay. And with the RAS's support, it may gain more ground; future space flights may need to accommodate both humans and robots."

      "content": "An experimental vehicle to develop an autonomous European re-entry capability for future reusable space transportation has completed its mission. The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV) flew a flawless reentry and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean just west of the Galapagos islands.<br /><br />The IXV spaceplane lifted off at 13:40 GMT (14:40 CET) on February 11 from Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, atop a Vega rocket. It separated from Vega at an altitude of 211 miles (340 kilometers) and continued up to 256 miles (412km). Re-entering from this suborbital path, it recorded a vast amount of data from more than 300 advanced and conventional sensors.<br /><br />As it descended, the 16.4-foot-long (5 meters), 2-ton craft maneuvered to decelerate from hypersonic to supersonic speed. The entry speed of 4.7 miles per second (7.5 km/s) at an altitude of 75 miles (120km) created the same conditions as those for a vehicle returning from low-Earth orbit.<br /><br />IXV glided through the atmosphere before parachutes deployed to slow the descent further for a safe splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />The Mission Control Center at the ALTEC Advanced Logistics Technology Engineering Center in Turin, Italy, closely monitored IXV during the mission, receiving flight and instrument data from the entire ground network, including the fixed ground stations in Libreville, Gabon, and Malindi, Kenya, and the station on the Nos Aries recovery ship in the Pacific.<br /><br />Balloons are now keeping IXV afloat while the recovery vessel hurries to pick it up. It will be returned to Europe for detailed analysis in ESA’s technical center, ESTEC, in the Netherlands.<br /><br />Mastering reentry will open a new chapter for ESA. Such a capability is a cornerstone for reusable launcher stages, sample return from other planets and crew return from space, as well as for future Earth observation, microgravity research, satellite servicing, and disposal missions.<br /><br />The initial results from the flight are expected to be released in around six weeks.<br /><br />The results will feed the Program for Reusable In-Orbit Demonstrator for Europe (Pride), which is being studied under funding decided at ESA’s last two Ministerial Councils. The reusable Pride spaceplane would be launched on Europe’s Vega light rocket, orbit, and land automatically on a runway.<br /><br />“IXV has opened a new chapter for ESA in terms of reentry capabilities and reusability,” said Jean-Jacques Dordain from ESA. “ESA and its member states, together with European space industry, are now ready to take up new challenges in several fields of space transportation, in future launchers, robotic exploration, or human spaceflight.”<br /><br />“This mission will teach us a lot about the technologies we need to apply in new launch systems, in particular when we think about reusable systems,” said Gaele Winters from ESA.<br /><br />“This was a short mission with big impact,” noted Giorgio Tumino from ESA. “The cutting-edge technology we validated today and the data gathered from the sensors aboard IXV will open numerous opportunities for Europe to develop ambitious plans in space transportation for a multitude of applications.”"

      "content": "An experimental vehicle to develop an autonomous European re-entry capability for future reusable space transportation has completed its mission. The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV) flew a flawless reentry and splashed down in the Pacific Ocean just west of the Galapagos islands.<br /><br />The IXV spaceplane lifted off at 13:40 GMT (14:40 CET) on February 11 from Europe’s Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, atop a Vega rocket. It separated from Vega at an altitude of 211 miles (340 kilometers) and continued up to 256 miles (412km). Re-entering from this suborbital path, it recorded a vast amount of data from more than 300 advanced and conventional sensors.<br /><br />As it descended, the 16.4-foot-long (5 meters), 2-ton craft maneuvered to decelerate from hypersonic to supersonic speed. The entry speed of 4.7 miles per second (7.5 km/s) at an altitude of 75 miles (120km) created the same conditions as those for a vehicle returning from low-Earth orbit.<br /><br />IXV glided through the atmosphere before parachutes deployed to slow the descent further for a safe splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />The Mission Control Center at the ALTEC Advanced Logistics Technology Engineering Center in Turin, Italy, closely monitored IXV during the mission, receiving flight and instrument data from the entire ground network, including the fixed ground stations in Libreville, Gabon, and Malindi, Kenya, and the station on the Nos Aries recovery ship in the Pacific.<br /><br />Balloons are now keeping IXV afloat while the recovery vessel hurries to pick it up. It will be returned to Europe for detailed analysis in ESA’s technical center, ESTEC, in the Netherlands.<br /><br />Mastering reentry will open a new chapter for ESA. Such a capability is a cornerstone for reusable launcher stages, sample return from other planets and crew return from space, as well as for future Earth observation, microgravity research, satellite servicing, and disposal missions.<br /><br />The initial results from the flight are expected to be released in around six weeks.<br /><br />The results will feed the Program for Reusable In-Orbit Demonstrator for Europe (Pride), which is being studied under funding decided at ESA’s last two Ministerial Councils. The reusable Pride spaceplane would be launched on Europe’s Vega light rocket, orbit, and land automatically on a runway.<br /><br />“IXV has opened a new chapter for ESA in terms of reentry capabilities and reusability,” said Jean-Jacques Dordain from ESA. “ESA and its member states, together with European space industry, are now ready to take up new challenges in several fields of space transportation, in future launchers, robotic exploration, or human spaceflight.”<br /><br />“This mission will teach us a lot about the technologies we need to apply in new launch systems, in particular when we think about reusable systems,” said Gaele Winters from ESA.<br /><br />“This was a short mission with big impact,” noted Giorgio Tumino from ESA. “The cutting-edge technology we validated today and the data gathered from the sensors aboard IXV will open numerous opportunities for Europe to develop ambitious plans in space transportation for a multitude of applications.”"

      "content": "August 25, 2005<br />NASAhas announced that the space shuttle likely won't fly before March 2006. Part of the delay is caused by the return of external tanks to the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, the space agency said.<br /><br />Insulating foam broke off of Discovery's external tank moments after STS-114 launched July 26, surprising astronauts and shuttle managers who thought the problem was fixed.<br /><br />Factory seconds<br />The first tank to be returned, ET-119, set sail on a covered barge Tuesday and should arrive at Michoud over the weekend. According to Wayne Hale, deputy manager of the shuttle program, the tank is expected to be back at the Kennedy Space Center's (KSC) Florida docks by mid-November. NASA plans to return two other external tanks — ET-120 and ET-118 — already on hand. Hale said the last of these would be shipped back to KSC in mid-January 2006.<br /><br />At an August 18 press conference, NASA's Bill Gerstenmaier said an area of interest on the tanks is the PAL (Protuberance Air Load) ramp, a hand-applied foam ridge that protects cables and pressurized lines during launch. The PAL ramp on STS-114's external tank shed the largest piece of foam. In 2003, falling foam caused damage that ultimately doomed space shuttle Columbia and its crew.<br /><br />\"We want to take a look at some of the tanks that are already set up, ready to go fly. So, we want to dissect some of the PAL ramps that are on vehicles,\" he said. \"I'm not picking March because we've made progress, but we're starting to understand … the areas that we want to do rework on. … We're going to have to repair the PAL ramp, we think,\" Gerstenmaier admitted. \"How exactly we do that, we don't know yet.\"<br /><br />\"We don't see that the task remaining before us is as difficult as the tasks we have behind us,\" said NASA Administrator Mike Griffin.<br /><br />Minority report<br />The Return to Flight Task Group published its final report August 17, the day before the press conference. Headed by former astronauts Thomas Stafford and Richard Covey, the group oversaw NASA's efforts to implement safety reforms recommended by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board.<br /><br />What made headlines was a minority opinion drafted by seven of the panel's 26 members blasting NASA management. The group pointed out that NASA scheduled and then delayed Discovery's return to space 15 times, and this schedule pressure affected what fixes would be considered. With a launch only a few months away, NASA managers shied away from long-term, and possibly superior, changes to the shuttle.<br /><br />Shuttle managers did not \"accurately evaluate how much or how little risk is associated with their decisions, particularly decisions to sidestep or abbreviate any given procedure or process,\" the report said.<br /><br />Management relied on past success as evidence of safety, a fault that played a role in both the Columbia and the 1986 Challenger disasters. \"It has proven irresistible for some officials to characterize the modified external tank as 'safer' … or even 'fixed,' when neither the baseline of the old tanks nor the quantitative improvement of the new design has been established,\" the report said. \"The tank may well be safer but without … objective evidence it is impossible to know.\"<br /><br />One result of these problems was skyrocketing costs. \"At the end of 2 ½ years and $1.5 billion or more, it is not clear what has been accomplished,\" the critique said.<br /><br />Neither Stafford, Covey, nor NASA management would comment on the minority view other than to say it represents the personal opinion of certain task-group members. Covey noted he thinks NASA managers are \"approaching risk and the acceptance of risk\" appropriately. \"We have to go fly to learn a lot of the things we learned on this flight,\" he said."

At its distance of nearly 2.7 billion miles, Neptune musters a span of 2\" and a magnitude of 7.7, rendering it visible in binoculars. High magnification in a telescope and steady seeing is needed to see its bluish-green disk. Neptune stands 6° north of the Sept. 19 Full Moon.<br  /><br  />You can track Neptune’s motion against the background of stars in eastern Aquarius using binoculars. The planet is located nearly 5° east of 4th-magnitude Phi (ϕ) Aquarii, and the gap reduces to less than 4° as the month progresses. Look for a triangle of 6th-magnitude field stars roughly 6.5° south of the Circlet in Pisces — Neptune is near this grouping all month. In fact, on Sept. 23, the planet makes a particularly close pass (1.5') of the westernmost star in the triangle. You’ll need a telescope to see this close appulse.<br  /><br  />Uranus rises around 10 P.M. local time on Sept. 1, and two hours earlier by Sept. 30. At midmonth, it is 20° high in the eastern sky by 11 P.M. local time. The magnitude 5.7 planet is an easy target for binoculars, although it remains challenging to spot in a dim part of southern Aries. A telescope shows a delightful pale bluish disk spanning 4\".<br  /><br  />To find Uranus, begin by searching for a triangle of stars formed by Omicron (ο), Sigma (σ), and Pi (≠) Arietis. This trio of 5th-magnitude stars stands 6° due north of Mu (μ) Ceti. Uranus starts the month in the lower middle of this triangle, equidistant from Omicron and Sigma. It then wanders westward toward Omicron as the month progresses. By Sept. 30, Uranus stands within 25' of this star. Note the gibbous Moon in the vicinity Sept. 24, with Uranus 5.5° northeast of our natural satellite shortly after rising.<br  /><br  />Mars is too close to the Sun to observe it during September. The Red Planet returns to the morning sky in December.<br  /><br  />Sept. 22 marks the autumnal equinox (3:21 P.M.

Crucially, they must have a temperature at their surface that allows liquid water to flow, so in this respect they are like Earth.<br  /><br  />Hycean worlds<br  /><br  />Madhusudhan and colleagues call these worlds \"Hycean,\" a portmanteau from the words hydrogen and ocean. They say these worlds can have a radius up to 2.6 that of Earth’s and be up to ten times as massive. That’s significantly larger than any planets previously considered habitable.<br  /><br  />The researchers also study the Hycean habitable zone—the range of distances from the parent star that allow for liquid water on the surface. And tt turns out that the Hycean habitable zone is significantly bigger than for terrestrial-like planets.<br  /><br  />That’s partly because the equilibrium temperature on these planets can be as high as 440 degrees Fahrenheit (227 degrees Celsius), much higher than for terrestrial planets. Under these conditions, liquid water could exist if the planet were tidally locked with the same side always facing the sun. In that case, one half of the planet would be too hot to support life while the other could be temperate.<br  /><br  />Another reason for the much broader zone is that “cold” Hycean worlds could support liquid water by virtue of their internal heating. Such planets would require little or no radiation from the parent star and so could orbit at vast distances. “Our results show that the [habitable zone] for Hycean planets is considerably wider than the terrestrial [habitable zone],” they say.<br  /><br  />Alien biosignature<br  /><br  />Should these planets support life, an important question is whether they would display measurable biosignatures. Madhusudhan and colleagues investigate this question in detail and say that the main biosignatures on Earth, such as oxygen, ozone and methane, are likely to be produced on Hycean worlds by processes unrelated to life. So they cannot be considered biosignatures on these worlds.<br  /><br  />However, metabolic processes on Earth produce a number of secondary compounds that are likely to be more easily detected in hydrogen rich atmospheres. These include dimethysulfide (DMS), dimethyldisulfide (DMDS), methanethiol (CH3SH), and carbonylsulfide (OCS).<br  /><br  />What’s more, because Hycean worlds are larger than terrestrial-like planets, they should be easier to study. Astronomers have already spotted a number of candidates, such as K2-18 b, an exoworld with a mass about eight times that of Earth which orbits a red dwarf some 124 light-years away. This planet has already been earmarked for study by the James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble’s replacement which is due for launch later this year.<br  /><br  />Madhusudhan and colleagues say that this investigation is promising. ”We predict that the approved Cycle 1 JWST observations of K2-18 b, a candidate Hycean planet, will be able to detect these biomarkers if present at the quantities considered in this work,” they say.<br  /><br  />So if K2-18 b and other Hycean worlds display biosignatures, we may see the first signs of life elsewhere in the Universe in the next few years. Fingers crossed for an uneventful launch of James Webb Space Telescope in the coming months.<br  /><br  />Ref: Habitability and Biosignatures of Hycean Worlds: arxiv.org/abs/2108.10888"

      "content": "Do barred galaxies have two or more supermassive black holes in the central region? Can a single black hole in the center create a bar?<br  /><br  />Nicolas Andreyev <br  />Estes Park, Colorado <br  /><br  />Barred spiral galaxies are fairly common throughout the universe — at least one-third to one-half of spiral galaxies show some kind of central bar structure, including our own Milky Way. Because bars form in the centers of galaxies, which is also where supermassive black holes reside, it’s easy to think the two are connected. However, the gravitational influence of a galaxy’s supermassive black hole is so limited that it has nothing to do with how or why a central bar forms.<br  /><br  />But, you may be saying, supermassive black holes contain millions or billions of Suns’ worth of mass. How can such a massive object not be related to the central bar? There are two main reasons: First, the influence of an object’s gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance you are from that object. This is a complicated way of saying that the gravitational pull you feel from something very quickly becomes weaker as you move away from it. So, given that the bulge of, say, the Milky Way stretches nearly 7,000 light-years across, the sphere of influence around its supermassive black hole is not nearly large enough to dictate the motions of material throughout the entire bulge. The second reason is that the mass of a galaxy’s bulge itself — the stars and gas — far outweighs that of its supermassive black hole. The difference is quite extreme: The average supermassive black hole accounts for only about 0.5 percent of the total mass in a galaxy’s bulge. <br  /><br  />So, despite its location, a supermassive black hole has nothing to do with the formation of a bar structure. Even the acquisition of an additional supermassive black hole from a colliding galaxy could not create a bar — such an event might, in fact, disrupt one. Galactic bars are instead caused by gravitational instabilities in the motion of material in a galaxy’s bulge. Because the material throughout a galaxy is not distributed evenly, instabilities arise in areas that start out slightly denser than their surroundings, causing them to attract more material. Given time, the orbits of numerous stars and gas clouds will overlap, creating the structure we see. This is similar to the way spiral arms are generated as density waves cause material in a galaxy’s disk to pile up in certain orbits like a traffic jam as the galaxy rotates. And although a bar or spiral arms may look solid, they are really just dense regions where more material is present. Their shape, size, and even existence can change within a single galaxy over its lifetime. <br  /><br  />Alison Klesman <br  />Senior Associate Editor"

      "content": "Q: Why do we still have meteor showers? If Earth is 4.5 billion years old, then it’s traveled through these meteor fields 4.5 billion times. So why haven’t all the meteors been pulled out of our orbit by now?<br  /><br  />Dwain Smith<br  />Sugar Land, Texas<br  /><br  />A: Since the moment it coalesced, Earth has had meteor showers. In the young solar system, the region near the Sun was crammed full of large objects that formed when the gravitational attraction among tiny particles brought them together. Meteorites (the largest of which could be called asteroids) continually struck Earth’s surface and even contributed to our planet’s eventual mass.<br  /><br  />After more than 4 billion years, the space between the planets has been swept clean of that initial material. But visitors from the depths of the solar system keep replenishing the supply, if only by adding dust-size particles. These visitors are comets, frozen balls of dirty ice when far from the Sun. But when its orbit carries a comet close to our star, solar radiation boils the ice from its surface and creates a glowing tail of gas. It also releases particles of dust trapped in the ice, generating a second tail of dust that reflects sunlight.<br  /><br  />This process, however, does more than produce a pleasant sight through a telescope or, occasionally, even to the naked eye. The released particles of dust persist, strewn along the comet’s path. If that path happens to cross Earth’s orbit, our planet will run into the particles at the same time each year. When it does, the particles enter our atmosphere and burn up, producing a meteor shower. <br  /><br  />This can happen even if the comet is a one-time visitor that will never return. But the persistent meteor showers like the Perseids in August and the Geminids in December are created by periodic comets that do return. The most famous example of a periodic comet, and the first one recognized as such, is Halley’s Comet, which last came close to the Sun in February 1986. It orbits once every 75⅓ years, meaning it will again be closest to the Sun in 2061.<br  /><br  />Each time a periodic comet returns to our neck of the woods, it replenishes the dust particles along its path, allowing us to enjoy meteor showers to this day. <br  /><br  />Michael E.

So they cannot be considered biosignatures on these worlds.<br  /><br  />However, metabolic processes on Earth produce a number of secondary compounds that are likely to be more easily detected in hydrogen rich atmospheres. These include dimethysulfide (DMS), dimethyldisulfide (DMDS), methanethiol (CH3SH), and carbonylsulfide (OCS).<br  /><br  />What’s more, because Hycean worlds are larger than terrestrial-like planets, they should be easier to study. Astronomers have already spotted a number of candidates, such as K2-18 b, an exoworld with a mass about eight times that of Earth which orbits a red dwarf some 124 light-years away. This planet has already been earmarked for study by the James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble’s replacement which is due for launch later this year.<br  /><br  />Madhusudhan and colleagues say that this investigation is promising. ”We predict that the approved Cycle 1 JWST observations of K2-18 b, a candidate Hycean planet, will be able to detect these biomarkers if present at the quantities considered in this work,” they say.<br  /><br  />So if K2-18 b and other Hycean worlds display biosignatures, we may see the first signs of life elsewhere in the Universe in the next few years.

      "content": "Do barred galaxies have two or more supermassive black holes in the central region? Can a single black hole in the center create a bar?<br  /><br  />Nicolas Andreyev <br  />Estes Park, Colorado <br  /><br  />Barred spiral galaxies are fairly common throughout the universe — at least one-third to one-half of spiral galaxies show some kind of central bar structure, including our own Milky Way. Because bars form in the centers of galaxies, which is also where supermassive black holes reside, it’s easy to think the two are connected. However, the gravitational influence of a galaxy’s supermassive black hole is so limited that it has nothing to do with how or why a central bar forms.<br  /><br  />But, you may be saying, supermassive black holes contain millions or billions of Suns’ worth of mass. How can such a massive object not be related to the central bar? There are two main reasons: First, the influence of an object’s gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance you are from that object. This is a complicated way of saying that the gravitational pull you feel from something very quickly becomes weaker as you move away from it. So, given that the bulge of, say, the Milky Way stretches nearly 7,000 light-years across, the sphere of influence around its supermassive black hole is not nearly large enough to dictate the motions of material throughout the entire bulge. The second reason is that the mass of a galaxy’s bulge itself — the stars and gas — far outweighs that of its supermassive black hole. The difference is quite extreme: The average supermassive black hole accounts for only about 0.5 percent of the total mass in a galaxy’s bulge. <br  /><br  />So, despite its location, a supermassive black hole has nothing to do with the formation of a bar structure. Even the acquisition of an additional supermassive black hole from a colliding galaxy could not create a bar — such an event might, in fact, disrupt one. Galactic bars are instead caused by gravitational instabilities in the motion of material in a galaxy’s bulge. Because the material throughout a galaxy is not distributed evenly, instabilities arise in areas that start out slightly denser than their surroundings, causing them to attract more material. Given time, the orbits of numerous stars and gas clouds will overlap, creating the structure we see. This is similar to the way spiral arms are generated as density waves cause material in a galaxy’s disk to pile up in certain orbits like a traffic jam as the galaxy rotates. And although a bar or spiral arms may look solid, they are really just dense regions where more material is present. Their shape, size, and even existence can change within a single galaxy over its lifetime. <br  /><br  />Alison Klesman <br  />Senior Associate Editor"

So why haven’t all the meteors been pulled out of our orbit by now?<br  /><br  />Dwain Smith<br  />Sugar Land, Texas<br  /><br  />A: Since the moment it coalesced, Earth has had meteor showers. In the young solar system, the region near the Sun was crammed full of large objects that formed when the gravitational attraction among tiny particles brought them together. Meteorites (the largest of which could be called asteroids) continually struck Earth’s surface and even contributed to our planet’s eventual mass.<br  /><br  />After more than 4 billion years, the space between the planets has been swept clean of that initial material. But visitors from the depths of the solar system keep replenishing the supply, if only by adding dust-size particles. These visitors are comets, frozen balls of dirty ice when far from the Sun. But when its orbit carries a comet close to our star, solar radiation boils the ice from its surface and creates a glowing tail of gas. It also releases particles of dust trapped in the ice, generating a second tail of dust that reflects sunlight.<br  /><br  />This process, however, does more than produce a pleasant sight through a telescope or, occasionally, even to the naked eye. The released particles of dust persist, strewn along the comet’s path. If that path happens to cross Earth’s orbit, our planet will run into the particles at the same time each year. When it does, the particles enter our atmosphere and burn up, producing a meteor shower. <br  /><br  />This can happen even if the comet is a one-time visitor that will never return. But the persistent meteor showers like the Perseids in August and the Geminids in December are created by periodic comets that do return. The most famous example of a periodic comet, and the first one recognized as such, is Halley’s Comet, which last came close to the Sun in February 1986. It orbits once every 75⅓ years, meaning it will again be closest to the Sun in 2061.<br  /><br  />Each time a periodic comet returns to our neck of the woods, it replenishes the dust particles along its path, allowing us to enjoy meteor showers to this day. <br  /><br  />Michael E.

At midmonth, it is 20° high in the eastern sky by 11 P.M. local time. The magnitude 5.7 planet is an easy target for binoculars, although it remains challenging to spot in a dim part of southern Aries. A telescope shows a delightful pale bluish disk spanning 4\".<br  /><br  />To find Uranus, begin by searching for a triangle of stars formed by Omicron (ο), Sigma (σ), and Pi (≠) Arietis. This trio of 5th-magnitude stars stands 6° due north of Mu (μ) Ceti. Uranus starts the month in the lower middle of this triangle, equidistant from Omicron and Sigma. It then wanders westward toward Omicron as the month progresses. By Sept. 30, Uranus stands within 25' of this star. Note the gibbous Moon in the vicinity Sept. 24, with Uranus 5.5° northeast of our natural satellite shortly after rising.<br  /><br  />Mars is too close to the Sun to observe it during September. The Red Planet returns to the morning sky in December.<br  /><br  />Sept. 22 marks the autumnal equinox (3:21 P.M. EDT), the time of year when the Sun appears on the celestial equator, moving southward."

      "content": "Do barred galaxies have two or more supermassive black holes in the central region? Can a single black hole in the center create a bar?<br  /><br  />Nicolas Andreyev <br  />Estes Park, Colorado <br  /><br  />Barred spiral galaxies are fairly common throughout the universe — at least one-third to one-half of spiral galaxies show some kind of central bar structure, including our own Milky Way. Because bars form in the centers of galaxies, which is also where supermassive black holes reside, it’s easy to think the two are connected. However, the gravitational influence of a galaxy’s supermassive black hole is so limited that it has nothing to do with how or why a central bar forms.<br  /><br  />But, you may be saying, supermassive black holes contain millions or billions of Suns’ worth of mass. How can such a massive object not be related to the central bar? There are two main reasons: First, the influence of an object’s gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance you are from that object. This is a complicated way of saying that the gravitational pull you feel from something very quickly becomes weaker as you move away from it. So, given that the bulge of, say, the Milky Way stretches nearly 7,000 light-years across, the sphere of influence around its supermassive black hole is not nearly large enough to dictate the motions of material throughout the entire bulge. The second reason is that the mass of a galaxy’s bulge itself — the stars and gas — far outweighs that of its supermassive black hole. The difference is quite extreme: The average supermassive black hole accounts for only about 0.5 percent of the total mass in a galaxy’s bulge. <br  /><br  />So, despite its location, a supermassive black hole has nothing to do with the formation of a bar structure. Even the acquisition of an additional supermassive black hole from a colliding galaxy could not create a bar — such an event might, in fact, disrupt one. Galactic bars are instead caused by gravitational instabilities in the motion of material in a galaxy’s bulge. Because the material throughout a galaxy is not distributed evenly, instabilities arise in areas that start out slightly denser than their surroundings, causing them to attract more material. Given time, the orbits of numerous stars and gas clouds will overlap, creating the structure we see. This is similar to the way spiral arms are generated as density waves cause material in a galaxy’s disk to pile up in certain orbits like a traffic jam as the galaxy rotates. And although a bar or spiral arms may look solid, they are really just dense regions where more material is present. Their shape, size, and even existence can change within a single galaxy over its lifetime. <br  /><br  />Alison Klesman <br  />Senior Associate Editor"

      "content": "Q: Why do we still have meteor showers? If Earth is 4.5 billion years old, then it’s traveled through these meteor fields 4.5 billion times. So why haven’t all the meteors been pulled out of our orbit by now?<br  /><br  />Dwain Smith<br  />Sugar Land, Texas<br  /><br  />A: Since the moment it coalesced, Earth has had meteor showers. In the young solar system, the region near the Sun was crammed full of large objects that formed when the gravitational attraction among tiny particles brought them together. Meteorites (the largest of which could be called asteroids) continually struck Earth’s surface and even contributed to our planet’s eventual mass.<br  /><br  />After more than 4 billion years, the space between the planets has been swept clean of that initial material. But visitors from the depths of the solar system keep replenishing the supply, if only by adding dust-size particles. These visitors are comets, frozen balls of dirty ice when far from the Sun. But when its orbit carries a comet close to our star, solar radiation boils the ice from its surface and creates a glowing tail of gas. It also releases particles of dust trapped in the ice, generating a second tail of dust that reflects sunlight.<br  /><br  />This process, however, does more than produce a pleasant sight through a telescope or, occasionally, even to the naked eye. The released particles of dust persist, strewn along the comet’s path. If that path happens to cross Earth’s orbit, our planet will run into the particles at the same time each year. When it does, the particles enter our atmosphere and burn up, producing a meteor shower. <br  /><br  />This can happen even if the comet is a one-time visitor that will never return. But the persistent meteor showers like the Perseids in August and the Geminids in December are created by periodic comets that do return. The most famous example of a periodic comet, and the first one recognized as such, is Halley’s Comet, which last came close to the Sun in February 1986. It orbits once every 75⅓ years, meaning it will again be closest to the Sun in 2061.<br  /><br  />Each time a periodic comet returns to our neck of the woods, it replenishes the dust particles along its path, allowing us to enjoy meteor showers to this day. <br  /><br  />Michael E.
